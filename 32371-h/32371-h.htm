<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7'></a>7</span>A few facts are perhaps needed in this place. The
autumn of 1921 found me in bad health, which
seemed to me to be gaining ground. The Editors
for whom it is my privilege to work were of that
mind too, and suggested a sea voyage. I am one
of that large class who can afford little more than
voyages in ships which are hauled over on chains;
but this was allowed for in every possible way by
my Editors, in consequence of whose active generosity
and that of the owners to whom my case was made
known, I suddenly found myself bound for the
River Plate. I can but say that when my friends
expressed their envy I was well able to understand
their feelings and my good luck.</p>

<p>For the rest, this little book is not intended for
anything beyond the statement on the title page.
I am sorry myself that there are no adventures
of the blood-curdling sort in it; but I could not
go out of my way, nor do tramps find time, it seems,
for propitiating cannibals. Of unrehearsed effects
on voyages, indeed, my belief is that it is possible
sometimes to have too much. Eastward of Madagascar,
we read, lies Tromelin Island&#8211;a sandbank a
mile long. In 1761 the <i>Utile</i> was wrecked there,
and eighty blacks were left behind; all died except
seven of the women, who clung to life for fifteen
years, nourished on shell fish and brackish water,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span>
until Captain Tromelin landed and saved them.
Now I cannot feel sorry that I was not one of that
party.</p>

<p>There is, naturally, some slender disguise of names
and so forth through my journal. There may be,
it occurs, a S.S. <i>Bonadventure</i> at the present day;
if it is so, this is not the ship. My grateful recollections
of Captain Hosea, his officers and crew
apply to those gentlemen indeed, but they do not
sign on by the names which I have for this occasion
invented. Thus their own example leads me;
how much oftener was I hailed as &#8220;Skylark&#8221; and
&#8220;Jonah&#8221; than as</p>

ho! Here am I, with the newsboys outside shouting
the latest imbecility to the murk, trying to get warm
and happy by considering a dull electric heater and
the faded memory of another ship (she went downstairs
in the war) which, years ago, on a December
morning, passed through the lock gates at Swansea
for Para and all, while I stood by her rail sorry for
the people who had not my luck. Now it is your
turn. Make the most of it. It will do something
to take away the taste of Stuff Trench. You will
find me, when you come home, still over the electric

<p>O, a Cardiff ship sails down the river</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Blow, boys, blow!)</p>

<p>Sing up, Blunden! And don&#8217;t forget to take soap,

wish presently you knew how to do it, if you have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span>
misspent your time and never learned. But I
suppose eighteenth-century literature and the baby
have absorbed all your energies. A pipe is only
fit for the idle-minded.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s another thing. Don&#8217;t forget that the
ship&#8217;s master is a greater man than a colonel. You
know colonels, don&#8217;t you? (All right, all right!)
Well, make no mistake about it, master mariners, as
a rule, are different. It is long odds that your new
master will know his job. If you are nice to him,
he may even confess to a taste for your poetry;
ships&#8217; masters are like pie, I have found, to little
lost children like ourselves who know nothing about
ships, but they are perfectly frightful towards those
who know all about ships, and know it all wrong.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span><a id='link_1'></a>I</h2>

<p>On the eleventh of January my uncertainty was
ended by the apparition (and in the village of Staizley
it is no less) of a girl with a telegram. Her walk
of three miles or thereabouts, from our nearest
telegraph office, brought her to my gate at three in
the afternoon; and with her customary awed speechlessness
she gave me her message. It was from
&#8220;Kingfisher,&#8221; the decoded entity of which was
the great shipping owner to whom I owed my arrangements;
and in response I hastily attempted to
leave a semblance of order behind me and to seem
unexcited. My luggage, no cumbrous affair, had
already been packed. By six, the trap of an ingenious
neighbour, who lives by all sorts of traps, was heard
at the gate, and Mary and myself got in. Determined
protest, not at my departure, but at the apparent
departure of her mother, was now raised by the
youngest among us. My comforting promises were
ignored, and the infant&#8217;s cries redoubled. Nevertheless,
off we went.</p>

<p>The evening had been pouring out, with the
vigour of an elemental Whistler, sleet and hail,
and now though the wind was down our drive
lay through fields half whitened with the storm;
and the air was livid with the clouded moon and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span>
as cold as the ebbing light. With its multitude
of pollards, its desolate great fields, its chilling
breaths, the countryside might have been Flanders.
This aspect seemed incidentally to demonstrate
the wisdom of going elsewhere for a month or
two.</p>

<p>We now came into Slowe, discussing all the time
our past, present and future; the chief result of
the discussion was the placing of my unanswered
letters at Mary&#8217;s disposal. The town of Slowe was
at peace. Its station wore the familiar air of
having nothing to do with the coarse noise of traffic.
Here Mary spent some moments in melancholy
visions of my funeral at sea. She hoped these were
wrong, and I, beginning to be affected also, hoped
so equally.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye&#8221; to Mary! The curve of the track
carried her out of sight, and, imagining with resolution
that the carriage was comfortably warm, I resigned
myself to the journey to Liverpool Street. By way
of passing the time, I fell back upon my habit of
considering how the Latin poets might render the
words, upon which few Englishmen have not been
reared:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>&#8220;The use of this rack for heavy and bulky packages....&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>But though the sentiment which they convey is
salutary, and though such metrical gifts as &#8220;graviora&#8221;
and &#8220;viatores&#8221; instantly suggested themselves, the
task once again defeated me.</p>

<p>Some such deadening pastime (Tennyson advises
it) was necessary. There are many stations between
Slowe and Liverpool Street, and the train, the last
of the day between those places, stopped at each
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>
one. Arrived in London, and shivering with cold,
I sought out my relations; reported with a certain
amount of pride, which evoked no corresponding
admiration at such a late hour, my impending
voyage, and was rewarded with a bed.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span><a id='link_2'></a>II</h2>

<p>My instructions were to present myself next morning,
without fail, at the shipping offices of Messrs. Wright,
Style and Storey, in Cardiff. Mary&#8217;s double accordingly
hurried me through my breakfast and led the
way to Paddington. I urged myself to realize that
I was going upon holiday; but, it cannot be withheld,
the thought of this particular pleasure had a
serious tinge. Paddington itself, to such an islander
as I am, had some of the credit of this. To me, that
large terminus is, as a jumping-off position, less
human than, for example, Victoria. From Paddington,
with its Western propaganda, it may well
seem that humanity is travelling out into the round
world&#8217;s imagined corners; but Victoria, with its
lesser range in sight, leaves a quieter speculation.
From Brighton there is no such press of mammoth
liners? Even when the destination was the B.E.F.,
it was comforting to me to set out from Victoria,
whence the way led through a compact, placid,
formerly uninternational, still un-Atlantic quarter.
A Society for the Suppression of Astronomers has
been mooted by the lazy-minded. I am not sure
that geographers should not be included. Distances,
no doubt, are as essential to romance as to Copley
Fielding&#8217;s water-colours; but they can rouse in some
of us troubling thoughts, which, summed up, say
&#8220;Leave us alone!&#8221; Such thoughts had disturbed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>
me when, with farewells from Bess, I retired to the
sporting columns of my newspaper, and the train
moved out.</p>

<p>In compensation for my experience of the previous
evening, the journey went quickly by. A sunny
morning, blue and still, lit up the country. So fine
was the day, and the country, with its ancient timber,
its mole-hilled pastures, its feeding horses and cheerful
rooks, appeared so mellow, that the wisdom of
leaving it behind was not so conspicuous as, the
night before, it had been. Cardiff. I knew nothing
about it, except as &#8220;Cardiff.&#8221; I entrusted myself,
therefore, to a taxi-driver, who claimed to know
more, even to the whereabouts of the shipping office
to which I was bound. After meanderings and
advice from the police and the public, he made
amends for his inaccuracy by setting me down at
the foot of a gloomy staircase leading to the rooms
of Messrs. Wright, Style and Storey.</p>

<p>And now for a few moments I was in trouble.
Thinking that the telegram which warranted my
calling at this Cardiff office of the London Company
would best explain my intrusion, I handed it over the
fateful counter. The clerk took it, assumed a serious
air, avoided looking at me, and referred to a superior.
I was puzzled. More so, the superior. A murderer,
concerned in the atrocity at Bournemouth, was at
that time untraced, and I fancy that the official had
the mystery in his mind at this point. At any rate,
eyeing the wire with doubt for some time, he suddenly
advanced towards me and put the question, in stern
accents: &#8220;Who are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Who are you?</p>

<p>I feel sure that my explanation was unbusinesslike,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>
but he presently divined the truth. Word of my movement
had not been sent him from London. He withdrew
to the telephone or time-table; then restoring
to me my sibylline leaf, told me to go to Barry Docks,
where I should find the <i>Bonadventure</i>, recognizable
by a white S painted on the funnel, lying at Tip
Eleven or Twelve, and to go aboard and report
myself to the captain. I went, fearing lest the captain
likewise might know as little in advance about the
trembling suspect before him.</p>

<p>Urchins scrambled for my luggage at the Barry
Docks Station, an hour or so later, and the two victors
hurried it along to Tip Eleven. These coal-tips overhead
and the shipping alongside, with knots of workmen
passing masked in coal-dust, engaged my mind as
we went, and before I was fully aware of it we were
aboard a vessel which the boys recognized as the <i>Bonadventure</i>.
I paid the carriers, who went away at
speed, and asked a wooden-faced seaman, who seemed
to be alone, where I could find the captain. He at
once cut short my search by the tone in which he
observed, &#8220;The captain! He&#8217;s having his dinner
at the present.&#8221; I was rebuked, and stood by. (I had
still to witness the multitudes who want to find the
captain of a ship in port.)</p>

<p>I took a look at the ship, but felt lost as I did so.
She was large, and of vague shape. I could not determine
where she began and where she left off. A pall of
coal covered everything. Heaps of cinders, which a
casual glance described as of some seniority, lay against
the deck railing. I saw hut-like structures about me
where I stood, amidships, as the boys had said; but I
feared to explore. At times some one with a plate or
a jug was seen stooping swiftly through their doorways&#8211;evidence
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>
indeed of the captain&#8217;s dinner-hour.
Inaction, nevertheless, grew unpromising; and at last
I asked an officer, as I rightly thought him, who had
come out to keep an eye on several blasphemous and
strongly individual beings with large spades, whether
I might see the captain. When he heard my business,
he quickly took me to him. I found myself speaking
to a quiet, smiling, and enviably robust man who, to
my relief, was not mystified by my arrival. He set me
at my ease, told me that I should sign on as a member
of the crew to-morrow, and allowed me to stay on the
ship meanwhile. I was glad of this, being weary of
quests for the time being.</p>

<p>Not quite at home, as may be gathered, I went out on
deck, and watched the tips in action; admired the
mimic thunder&#8211;first the abrupt and rending, shattering
crash, then the antistrophe of continued rollings&#8211;which
each truckful of coal makes as it is tumbled into
the shoot and thereby into the ship&#8217;s holds. Truck
after truck was drawn up, the pin knocked away from
the end board and the coal hurled, its dusky clouds
fuming out, into the ship: its atmosphere did not seem
to strain or irritate the breathing organs of those
worthies with the spades, and the pipes, whose vague
labouring silhouettes enlivened the gloom. Engines
plied constantly beside the docks with long trains of
coal. As if expressing itself, one emitted a peculiar
twofold groan. All this, of course, ancient history, but
I was new to it. It seemed like the beginnings of
wisdom.</p>

<p>But the world of iron and smoke could not warm my
body as well as it did my mind, and while I was
brooding over the increasing bite in the air of that
January afternoon, the officer whom I was to know
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>
soon as the mate, a young man of clear-cut features and
tranquil manner, told me to make use of the saloon.
I sat there reading, when another introduction took
place. The steward, a weighty old man remarkable
at first sight for his brown skull-cap, came in to say he
had fitted me up with a cabin. Following him up a
staircase, I took over this dugout-like dwelling with no
small satisfaction. It was to be my home, he said, for
three or four months on this South American run. I
unpacked, and washed away the unearned, and
unsuspected, film of coal-dust which was to characterize
my home for the same length of time.</p>

<p>Tea came, and I was mildly puzzled again, when the
steward&#8217;s assistant asked me to choose between a
bloater, cold meat, and so on. I was deciding on
something slenderer, when I realized that tea included
supper, and applied for a kipper. The captain&#8217;s wife
kept conversation alive. The topic, I remember, was
the lamented custom which once permitted captains&#8217;
wives to make &#8220;the round trip&#8221; with their husbands.</p>

<p>The coal still rattled into the holds every moment
or two, and the same process was going on all round
us. The water was bright in the moon, and the
reflections of the lamps fastened high over the ships
swum like golden serpents in the ripples. In such a
light, to such a watcher, there seemed no end to the
serried framework and the cordage to the giant sea
travellers of steel. The constant clanging and whistling
and crash spoke to the work of the machines, an
occasional shout to the guiding energies of the men.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span><a id='link_3'></a>III</h2>

<p>The shipping office itself left no clear impression
upon me, the next morning, when I attended the
business of signing on; but the visit gave me my
first view of the crew of the <i>Bonadventure</i>, which was
welcome. Many of them were coloured men, as
ever, dressed in eye-catching smartness. I reflected
on the extent to which the market of boots of two
colours must depend on these firemen. Among the
others, a Cornishman of odd automatic gait, whose
small head balanced a squarish black hat, moved about
with an inconsequence suggestive of some clever
comedian. He gave, however, no evidence of humorous
abilities. The wooden-faced man, to whom I
have referred, answered the call of &#8220;Cook.&#8221; Sitting
on the bench in the corner, I felt a curious stare
upon me, and looking across the room, saw its owner,
a tough customer by the expression he wore. For
some peculiarity of conduct, this sailor was the
next evening removed from the <i>Bonadventure</i> by
the police, with no passive resistance, as I vaguely
heard. The police recovered.</p>

<p>Two youths sat by me, their good nature showing
itself in their talk. They painted my near future.
The heat we should soon be feeling, 130 in the shade;
the troubled Biscay, where &#8220;seven seas meet, which
causes a great upheaval,&#8221; chequered the vista.
The function of crossing the Line was described as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>
bygone, even in its less inconvenient traditions, such
as giving the greenhorn binoculars through which a
(hair) &#8220;Line&#8221; was plain enough.</p>

<p>My name was called, and I went to the front.
The captain conferred with the clerk. For technical
purposes, as I supposed, I was put down &#8220;purser.&#8221;
The rank was given, but not the talents.</p>

<p>Now, the hour of the <i>Bonadventure&#8217;s</i> sailing being
imminent, the ship&#8217;s officers who had been away
were returning. The chief engineer, obviously regarded
as a wise man; the second mate, full of stories;
the wireless operator, youthful and brilliantined,
appeared at the cabin table. The captain&#8217;s wife
drew up matrimonial plans for the third mate, who
was not beyond blushing over his late tea&#8211;the not
impossible, but improbable, She was evidently a
recognized memory of Hamburg. The captain was
striving to get at the facts when a doctor came in,
summoned to see an apprentice; and he left his
meal to hear the diagnosis. Reappearing, he said,
&#8220;The only bit of luck we&#8217;ve had. The boy&#8217;s got
appendicitis.&#8221; This was not euphemism; what
might have happened had the ship left before the
boy&#8217;s illness was known for what it was, both to
boy and authorities, he went on to hint. This
piece of recognition was due to the mate.</p>

<p>We were not leaving that evening, though loading
ceased. I walked into Barry, and found its cinematograph
programme somewhat worse than is the
average. This, and the change of the weather
from keen to mizzling, persuaded me back to my
cabin for the rest of the evening; and after the
night&#8217;s rest, broken sometimes by sounds of &#8220;mighty
workings,&#8221; I looked through my porthole to discover
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>
that the ship had left the tips. She was now lying,
under a cloudy, showery sky, well out to the middle
of the water, and the buildings round the Docks
Station, dwarfed somewhat by the large sign of
&#8220;WARD, BUTCHER,&#8221; were in sight. We should
soon be away.</p>

<p>The solidity of ship&#8217;s breakfast was an early fact
among those I was gleaning. Yesterday, an ample
steak, with potatoes&#8211;and onions&#8211;had been set
before me, after the preparatory porridge; this
day, two tough sausages, with potatoes&#8211;and onions&#8211;were
provided. Yet I fell to with an appetite,
and only hoped I should feel as able in the days to
come.</p>

<p>The inert morning seemed suited to the curious
quiet of the ship. That quiet was, however, disturbed
in undertone. The incessant tramp of feet
and sometimes the banging of gear were echoing.
The final period, in the main &#8220;all serene,&#8221; could
not be without its thousand and one adjustments;
though the holds, trimmed, I suppose, even to the
steward&#8217;s satisfaction&#8211;he had been in high choler
the night before at the attempted delivery of meat
to a store just made inaccessible by the delivery of
coal&#8211;now were covered with tarpaulins. I had
time to meditate, and the cold air recommended my
cabin as the place.</p>

<p>To the Plate and back again, in a cargo ship!
(To the Somme and back again&#8211;that had seemed less
surprising.) The voyage, no doubt, would be more
arduous than that in the leave-boat from Boulogne
to Folkestone. Would my resolution be equal to
the greater strain on the system? I suspected that
the first few days might find me groaning within
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>
myself; asking why I had left my draughty study,
which was at least stationary? what I had found
amiss with the array of books for review&#8211;pleasant,
unjustly despised labour? Landlord, insurance
agent, general dealer, rags-and-bones, watch-and
clock-repairer, bricklayer come to fix the chimney,
carpenter to take measurements for far-off bookshelves,
secretary of football for subscriptions, and
many another familiar&#8211;in the middle of an attempt
to answer the question, &#8220;What is Poetry?&#8221;&#8211;should
I be considering them as unhonoured privileges?
Repent, repent.</p>

<p>From the mild exercise, and a book, I was aroused
by the brown skull-cap of the steward, who in some
pain of feature uttered round the door a solemn
&#8220;Well, I declare!&#8221; I had disregarded his bell&#8211;Jim
had rung it; he had rung it&#8211;for dinner.</p>

<p>There were friendly visitors afterwards. I was
wished a good voyage, and a better room&#8211;one
more artistic, I think, was in the speaker&#8217;s mind.
But comfort was cordially anticipated. The ship
was not one of the older sort that roll. The captain,
too, said that his ship did not roll. The shore
captain grinned, but said nothing, except that, if I
had been over to France, I should find the voyage
just the same. It was the captain&#8217;s turn to grin.
Next, the second mate came, book in hand, and
entered the name of my next-of-kin.</p>

<p>During the afternoon the funnel of the <i>Bonadventure</i>
had sent forth smoke, and the hooter,
hoots; the cold increased, and, having heard that
we were to go out at about six, for all my apprehensions
I felt eager for that hour. The surroundings
were gloomy. The <i>Bonadventure</i> lay in a row
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>
of coal-carrying steamers, with something grim
about their iron flatness; the <i>Phryne</i>, <i>Marie Nielsen</i>,
<i>Sandvik</i>, many another, their cold colours reminding
me of the huge blue-painted unexploded shell which
once I ventured to help remove from a trench at
Givenchy. The grey-green pool swilled sulkily about
them: and the red bricks in the background offered
no relief to an unprogressive eye. Sooty, hard and
bleak, the scene itself urged my impatience to be
gone.</p>

<p>A call announced the arrival of the pilot; and,
at ten minutes to six, in obedience to a process of
which I gathered little, the ship began to move
gently out of the dock. The shouts of the pilot on
the bridge, his &#8220;Hard-a-port,&#8221; his &#8220;Hard-a-starboard,&#8221;
were taken up from the forepart of the ship,
where a number of substantial figures were at work
with winch and cable. The <i>Bonadventure</i> was guided
with nice gradation into a channel not much exceeding
her own width; on the quay beside men were shouting
and scampering; the wireless clerk leaning
over against all gravity grabbed a bag of &#8220;mail&#8221;
from one of them; and out we passed. The wind
livened. The lights of the town slowly dwindled
behind us. Into the channel close after the <i>Bonadventure</i>
came the green lamp of another ship. Soon
the <i>Bonadventure</i> was definitely, at a growing speed,
running down the Bristol Channel, under a veiled
sky through which the moon always seemed about
to emerge, and among the scattered lights of other
ships going into Barry, or waiting in readiness to go
in.</p>

<p>The thing had never occurred to me before, and
I may be pardoned for reflecting, while I stood
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>
watching, in a manner somewhat grandiose. The
energy of Man, maker of cathedrals, high-roads,
aqueducts, railroads, was passing before me; and
this one manifestation of it seemed perhaps the
most surprising. The millions of times that this
restless creature Man had weighed his anchor and in
cockle-shell or galleon or clipper or tramp set out to
ferry over the seas at his own sweet will! This
matter was now put in a more prosaic light by the
wireless clerk, who, beckoning me to a place out of
the wind, informed me that at a charge he could,
as soon as the <i>Bonadventure</i> was out of touch of
land, transmit any message I had for home. With
this youngster I tried to speak on his own province,
in which I had made some elementary excursions in
Flanders times: but this intrusion upon his mysteries
appeared to affect him, and I learned only that the
modern wireless was different.</p>

<p>The doleful tolling of a bell, later on, with its
suggestion of the Inchcape Rock, reached me in
my bunk, where, noticing the oscillations of the ship,
I had early withdrawn.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span><a id='link_4'></a>IV</h2>

<p>My theory of repentance during the first few days
at sea was to be fact. At the start, I seemed to
myself to be perfectly steady. The breeze blew
cold; I thought it even pleasant; and without
over-exercise, I took my last views of English coasts,
and watched ships ahead of us blackly smudging a
vaporous sky. I attended dinner, and began to swell
with vanity.</p>

<p>By this time the ship was rolling (after all yesterday&#8217;s
kind assurances). There was no mistake about
it: and my vanity and observation were at once
cut short by a surprise attack of sea-sickness. A
dismal cowardice came on me. The wind seemed
changing, or perhaps&#8211;I inquired but little&#8211;the course
of the ship; the effect needed no inquiry. Time
and again, lowering my <i>morale</i> at each arrival, the
seas beat in a great crash upon the ship&#8217;s sides, and,
with the attendant tilt, the scarcely less welcome
seethe of the waters flowing down the decks would
follow. The ship seemed to be provided with cogs,
on which she was raised and lowered with horrible
deliberate jolts over a half-circle: then again, the
big wave would jump in with a punch like some
giant Fitzsimmons. My experience was growing.
The sunshine died off the porthole; the breeze was
half a gale already, droning and whining louder and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>
louder; and I felt that my breaking-in was to be
thorough enough.</p>

<p>Captain Hosea found time, now and then, to look
at his passenger. We kept up eloquent discourse,
though I was handicapped. The origin of species
and the riddle of the universe are topics on which
much enlivening debate may occur, and certainly
did then; but the floor of the debating society
should be made steady and not to lift and lean and
recover with a monstrous jerk as a point is being
approached. &#8220;It&#8217;s fierce,&#8221; said he, referring to
the idea of infinite abyss. I could agree from the
smaller one which I myself seemed to be probing.</p>

<p>Sleep was not easy during these early hours of my
holiday. I spent an awkward night or two, listening
to rattlings of all sorts, the battering-ram shocks
of the seas, and the thump of the engines, watching
the sweat on the rivets of my roof roll like the bubble
in a spirit-level, and my towel float out to an apparent
unperpendicular side to side. In this state of things
I easily came to know the features of my cabin,
described on the door-key as &#8220;spare cabin port.&#8221;
Amidships it was, between the wireless operator&#8217;s
premises and the captain&#8217;s. The porthole faced the
poop, and more immediately, the ship&#8217;s squat funnel.
Beneath the porthole, a padded seat was fixed;
and I had on one length of the room a disused radiator,
a chest of drawers and a washstand with mirror, where,
despite a ventilator above, light rarely seemed to
come. On the opposite length there was a tall
malodorous cupboard and two bunk beds, of which
I chose the lower one from sound instinct at the
beginning, keeping to it from force of habit afterwards.
Such was my dwelling; but I must not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>
fail to mention the electric light and fan. The place
was painted white, but its past use as a store had
variegated it.</p>

<p>The steward likewise visited me here, and sympathized.
The old fellow talked to me much as if
I had known him all my life; he being known well
enough, indeed, to the company for whom he was
going to sea in his old age. A scarred nose distinguished
him for a time. He complained, with a sort
of personal visualization of the sea&#8217;s boorishness, that
while attending to some stores he had been blown off
a case into a barrel of flour.</p>

<p>Having therefore spent the best part of my first
two days at sea in my cabin, which offered no great
variety in itself, I was much pleased to find myself
able to arise, manfully, the third day. But I avoided
breakfast. The morning looked inviting, the black
funnel gleaming even richly in the sun, so presently
I took the air. First, I had found some difficulty in
shaving, even with a safety razor; but it was accomplished.</p>

<p>We were still in the Bay of Biscay, and the <i>Bonadventure</i>
had not done lurching and wallowing. To
my naïve eye, the sea was in considerable commotion.
Like ever-changing rocky coasts, the horizon rose and
fell. As unsteady as that, the day left behind its
sunny comfort and brought clouds and chillier air. I
saw the navigators passing on their business, but I
could not emulate their equipoise; I attached myself
to a rail or fixture to watch them, this one coiling a
rope, that trailing a coco-nut mat in the sea&#8211;a capital
cleanser; to watch the gulls also, so easily keeping
up with the plunging brows, amid all their side-shows
of wheeling and darting flights. Inured, I presently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>
joined in at dinner in the saloon; ate, and had no
serious trouble. A framework, which was described as
a &#8220;fiddle,&#8221; covered the table and checked the more
mobile crockery; but it could not prevent an accident
in the steward&#8217;s own department, which caused his
tone of private feud with Neptune to sound clearly in
the apostrophe, &#8220;Break &#8217;em all, then, so we shall have
none for the fine weather.&#8221; But fine weather was
expected now.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span><a id='link_5'></a>V</h2>

<p>My prospect brightened with the weather. &#8220;Things
are looking bad,&#8221; observed the chief engineer with
an anxious glance at me. &#8220;Why?&#8221; I said more
anxiously. &#8220;There&#8217;s three teaspoons missing,&#8221; he
answered, satisfied at having played his joke. The
morning, though the wind blew hard against us, was
sunny and cheerful; the light blue sky flying here and
there the streamer of a shining cloud, the moon going
down ahead of us, the drove of gulls still pleasing
themselves in glistening whims of flight among the
waves. Warmer it was, but not yet warm enough
for me: and going out on the deck I often sheltered
behind the cabins with fingers as of old turning waxen
for want of blood. I found the ancient sea a new
pleasure in its aspects: I liked to see the wave-tops
suddenly become crystalline with a clear green glow.
Such a greenness immediately associated itself with,
and, I even thought, comprehended, the curious
emanation of the old mermaid stories. It is a light
wherein the sudden arising of a supernatural might
seem natural.</p>

<p>Aboard, less remote interests revealed themselves.
The cook, that lean aproned figure, walked slowly
between the stores and his stronghold the galley,
carrying perhaps a couple of large onions; and the
smell of cooking might rise above that of the Atlantic.
The tawny firemen emptied their buckets of cinders
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>
in long series through the iron chute over the side;
or found, by request, work for an oilcan round the
funnel. Everything said, in its manner, &#8220;No blind
hurry, no delay.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hosea invited me to his ampler room for daily
conversations over the friendly glass; we talked
much, but not about the sea. His active mind,
after searching through the files of recent newspapers
saved up during his stay in port, had many an opinion
on affairs less adjacent; and he had a curious miscellany
of reading at his service. Sir Edwin Arnold
was one of his few poets, and for him he spoke out
most generously. Here I was obliged to watch my
behaviour. As a person engaged in literature, I
could not precisely admit the ignorance of the <i>Light
of Asia</i> which I have always enjoyed; and I wished
I had read it. The conversation should have run
upon the sharks, the hula hula, typhoon and the submarine
barrage, by rights; not upon the history in
blank verse of the founder of Buddhism. It was some
relief to find Hosea turning to Tennyson, whose
works he had upon his desk. Shakespeare, he said,
he had been advised by old captains to leave alone
until he had turned forty.</p>

<p>From his book cupboard he lent me several books,
of which I only failed to master one. This was <i>The
Lone Star Ranger</i>, by Zane Grey; a fiction in which
beauty was reached through blood, but not in this
world. Far more romantic was a large official treatise
styled <i>North Atlantic Directory</i>, reading which, I
determined never again to leave any book about ships
and the sea in the threepenny tub.</p>

<p>Meals, the important thing in the trenches, began
to impress me as furnishing the incidents of seafaring
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>
life. They seldom came too soon. Their atmosphere
puzzled me in a minor way, until I was acclimatized to
the habits of the saloon. Little would be said at
them for a long time; then some one would quietly
mention some occurrence of technical bearings in
the first place, and so educed, a few anecdotes would
follow. Phillips, the chief engineer, with his seasoned
air and dry ironical ease of speech, was perhaps the
narrator of the saloon. I remember his first tale
that I heard: it was simple, yet picturesque. &#8220;Once
we were running in the banana trade. We went to
Labrador for some fish. The captain was putting
in to Cape Sidney, and he didn&#8217;t like the look of some
of the lights. So he went down to the bottle and
got blotto. The second mate&#8211;a little Greek, he was&#8211;was
on the bridge, and he found the captain was
blotto, and he&#8217;d never been to Cape Sidney before,
and he was worried out of his wits. So he came
down and asked me what he should do. &#8216;I can&#8217;t
tell you,&#8217; I said. &#8216;But if I were you, I should
bring her round in circles outside here until daylight
comes.&#8217; And there he stayed, steering round in circles
all night.&#8221;</p>

<p>The ship was reckoned, by those in higher authority,
to do ten knots to the hour, but for a week or so her
average was no more than eight. This circumstance
was never far away from our table-talk. The playful
interrogative &#8220;Ten?&#8221; would welcome Phillips
to his place at dinner, as the second mate handed
him the slip giving the results of the midday observations.</p>

<p>As the ship&#8217;s officers and the sailors became better
used to me, and I to them, my voyage began to assume
its intended holiday character. The southward
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>
progress of the <i>Bonadventure</i>, disappoint her chief
engineer as she might, was felt in the improving
weather; and as sea weather was still a new world
to me, I was never for long without some variation of
amusement. The colours of the rainbow in the waves
leaping up at the ship&#8217;s side and in the veils of spray
that they flung to the whisking wind were soon reflecting
themselves in my remembrance. On dark blue
ridge of surly water and on snowy coronal, the broken
arc of the rainbow was for ever flickering, just beyond
the uncertain shadow of the ship. The lively wind,
meanwhile, as if by a sudden stronger impulse, would
whirl the green toppling seas over the lower deck,
and the light cold spray as high as the bridge. Here,
I thought, was a lyric indeed; and so, it looked,
thought the gulls that disported about the ships,
and the shoals that, I fancied, like those of any
small stream, would be up to enjoy the sun.</p>

<p>Swabbing was going on aboard at a great pace.
The boatswain, a sort of combined walrus and
carpenter, seldom allowed his swabbers and his
hosepipe to rest. The flow of dirty water from the
cabin roofs made the deck dangerous ground. So
perish all accumulated dust! The <i>Bonadventure</i>
began to look clean, even resplendent.</p>

<p>When Hosea joined the merchant service, he tells
me, old hands would often make a disparaging comment
upon the decline of sailing days. &#8220;I&#8217;m giving
up going to sea. I&#8217;m going in steamers.&#8221; True, in
the very names of the old sails, up to their skyscrapers
and their moonrakers, there lingers yet the elemental
dignity of the earlier sort of argosy. Even the same
metaphorical fountain of description seems to have
ceased to flow with the falling asleep of the famous
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>
clippers: and I doubt whether the author of <i>London
River</i>, that rich reverie, kindred with an essay which
has weathered a hundred years&#8217; storms&#8211;Charles
Lamb&#8217;s <i>South-Sea House</i>&#8211;would write of the sea
to-day in his translucent classical revivings:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>&#8220;The model of this Russian ship was as memorable as a Greek statue.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>And yet, once or twice already, I was indistinctly
aware of an antique look about the ship forward,
with her dark beak and all her shrouds and spars
and winches; as I watched her at twilight ploughing
a grey sea and still driving afield towards a horizon
of sad vapours, braided with the sunset&#8217;s waning red,
and, from time to time until darkness settled, creviced
with a primrose gleam, calm, clear and sweet amid its
shadows.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span><a id='link_6'></a>VI</h2>

<p>A swell running in its long undulations accompanied
us until we had passed Madeira, beyond its horizons.
Mugs of tea slid suddenly and swiftly across the saloon
table; complaints were made at every meal, and
the mate hinted, with dreadful implications for my
benefit, that a special memorandum would be presented
to Father Neptune, expected on board shortly.
Other hints of the passenger&#8217;s future trials were made.
We were bound for the Plate, but we might be sent
thence to Australia. That addition, as a possibility,
to my holiday perturbed me somewhat; I envisaged
the bailiffs in at home before I got back.</p>

<p>The second mate, Bicker, and the third mate,
Mead, invited me to see their observations and their
watches. Bicker, a fine audacious spirit, dark-haired,
dark-eyed, four-or-five-and-twenty years old,
had my company in the afternoon, the days being
warm and inviting. The typical scene below the
bridge was of Mead in his singlet rigging up a line,
whereon towels, socks and other properties were
soon in the sun; while mattresses aired over the
cargo-hatch tarpaulin. Other toil at this hour,
save that of the engines and the man at the wheel,
was not noticeable. The boatswain and his wrinkled
party, who actually did leave a sea-salt impression
in their stocking-turbans and greasy rags and roomy
sea-boots, had left the midships white, and had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>
changed their ground for hose and scrubber to the
neighbourhood of the engines and the galley; but
the afternoons heard them not. An occasional
whistle from the bridge would summon hurrying feet
up the ladder; the striking of the bell made Time&#8217;s
pace perceived. Bicker would sometimes interrupt
his large stories to show me, or to try to show me,
remote or tiny curiosities floating past the ship.
Perhaps a shoal of young porpoises bobbing along
portended a slight squall, its approach yielding those
ever remarkable lights that mark broken rain, lily-of-the-valley
green, and on the waters a silver glitter,
while a shadow drooped over all. The third mate&#8217;s
drying-ground was speedily cleared at these times.</p>

<p>Mead&#8217;s watch occupied the four hours before noon,
and the four before midnight. At noon he would
join with Bicker in &#8220;Shooting old Sol,&#8221; a process
which, with its turning-up of pages packed with
figures, reminded me of old trouble in a famous
mathematical school of severe traditions, where hung
on the walls a symbolic picture&#8211;a youth swimming
for dear life from a gigantic shark. In the evening
I would find Mead on the bridge, uttering to himself
as likely as not his talismanic motto: <i>Quo Fata
Vocant</i>. He was a rover; from China he had gone
to Australia to join the Army in 1914; thence had
seen Gallipoli, Egypt, and, I believe, Palestine; went
into the Navy with a commission after that; and
now had returned to the life in which he had been
apprenticed a dozen years before. As these evening
colloquies with Mead became a rule with me, and as
it was Mead whom I came to know better than anyone
else, other matters relating to him will be found in
their places.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>There was no lack of good spirits aboard. Reminiscences
of a humorous tinge came up in almost every
conversation; and conversation was an earnest and
frequent affair. Indeed, there was observable a
certain rivalry (as with those who supply the fashionable
memoirs of the past twenty or thirty years),
who should remember the most: and each speaker
showed a vigorous faith in his own tale, which he
scarcely extended to his predecessor&#8217;s. The mate,
the clear-headed Meacock, with his blunt serenity&#8211;embodying
qualities in which I could not help seeing
the English seaman of the centuries&#8211;was eloquent
one evening about examiners. Examinations lie
thick in the navigator&#8217;s early way. He recalled one
well-known figure of these inquisitions, who, at a
time when no dinner interval was allowed to the candidates,
used to bring out frying-pan, steak and the
rest, and tantalize every one by cooking himself his
dinner. (I wondered if this suggestion might be
passed on to the Universities.) Another original,
Meacock went on, warming himself with the recollection,
had a preference for ordinary, that is seafaring,
words.</p>

<p><i>Examiner.</i> If I carry this barometer up a
mountain, what happens?</p>

<p><i>Candidate.</i> The mercury in the barometer subsides.</p>

<p><i>Examiner (purple with disgust).</i> You silly idiot, if
you were sitting on a table and I knocked you off,
would <i>you</i> subside?</p>

<p>Bicker was about to put in a reminiscence of his at
this point, but Meacock was already giving another
instance of this examiner&#8217;s zeal for pure English.</p>

<p><i>Examiner (producing a piece of wood).</i> What
colour&#8217;s this?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span><i>Candidate.</i> Chocolate.</p>

<p><i>Examiner (purple once more).</i> Chocolate! Chocolate
be dam&#8217;d. Chocolate&#8217;s something to eat&#8211;What
<span class='sc'>COLOUR</span> is it?</p>

<p>The chief engineer, seeing me somewhat handicapped
by temperament from wandering about as
inquisitively as I ought to have done, came up one
afternoon to take me into &#8220;<i>his</i> little slice of the ship.&#8221;
I am sorry to think how vague my imagination and
how inactive my gratitude had been up to that first
descent down the iron stairways and crossings to the
engine-room. The stifling air and the throbbing
roar, of course, kept my notions vague, but the degree
of vagueness was not so disgraceful as it had been.
He pointed out all things to one comprehending
scarcely anything, except a chalk legend on the wall
which ran:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>Aston Villa</p>
<p>Celtic</p>
<p>Manchester U,</p>
</div>

<p>and so on, which I noticed for myself. The ruling
passion&#8211;(passion at the referee&#8217;s ruling, says the
cynic).</p>

<p>I was aware, meanwhile, of vast steel rods and arms
in violent motion, named severally by the chief in a
mighty voice, which nevertheless was too much of a
whisper for me. The gangways round them, it was
easier to learn, were narrow and greasy. The cool
skill with which an engineer was anointing these
whirling forms, his hand dapping mothlike with the
tapering can above them, was enough to amaze me.
Under a strange construction like a kiln, by way of
a low red door, we went into the vault where the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>
dusky, glowing and actually grinning firemen were
tending the furnaces. (It happens all day, every
day in thousands of ships!) Above, we had
looked in at a dark hole&#8211;I rightly thought, over
the boilers&#8211;and breathed for a moment a most
parching element, so that the heat of the stokehold
did not frighten me. The chief introduced me to
the third engineer, Williams&#8211;we roared out cordially;
and then he inducted me to the mysteries aft, where,
along the shaft which revolves the propeller, a specially
greasy passage runs. Here, as throughout this
cavernous region&#8211;I remembered Hedge Street
Tunnels, which to the initiated will be a sufficient
allusion&#8211;might not E. A. Poe, to-day, have set a
story to rival the <i>Cask of Amontillado</i>? I suggested
it to the chief, but he saw no adventurous, unusual
quality in his tunnel. Right aft appeared a long
vertical ladder, ascending to a manhole&#8211;a safety
appliance, he explained it, of the war, but to me it
resembled a danger appliance.</p>

<p>Having gone as far as we could, we turned back to
the engine-room. I was now accustomed enough to
notice that the sultry air of the place was occasionally
tempered by a draught of the cooler kind. But I found
it hard to realize how man could tolerate surroundings
so trying as these in order to earn a wage which in
a comfortable employment would be nothing out of
the way. I pictured myself as an engineer on a
steamer. I feared that, in time, the approach of
each watch of four hours down among the machinery,
fume, sweat and thunder would become a formidable
problem. &#8220;Use&#8221; no doubt explained the nonchalance
of pallid Williams as he groped with his slush-lamp
to his work. But I thought of the war, when,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>
after a while, useful &#8220;use&#8221; began to desert the
soldier and to leave him on tenterhooks worse than
the apprehensions of the unused.</p>

<p>We were climbing upstairs again&#8211;up from the
underworld of battle headquarters?</p>

<p>I had appreciated the handful of cotton waste which
the chief had given me at the first: and now went
off to read poems. The man to whom this &#8220;divelish
yron yngine&#8221;&#8211;if I do not misquote Spenser&#8211;is given
for control (and is controlled), returned to his outstanding
labour&#8211;that of filing part of a curious
patent electric torch which the captain had asked him
to restore to life.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span><a id='link_7'></a>VII</h2>

<p>The <i>Bonadventure</i> entered the tropics, calm, hot,
blue expanse. I do not know why, but our passing
into that zone was for me contemporary with an
access of wild and vivid dreams. These were odd
enough to cause me to record what remained of
them in the morning, and as they still seem prominent
in my recollections of my sea-going, I make a note of
some of them. Now, it was no other than the great
Lord Byron, pursuing me with a knife, applauded
by two ladies. The basis of actuality, at least, was
there. Now I was taking my way along weedy rivers,
which at first were the innocent shallow streams I
once met and knew in Kent. But as the dream
progressed a Byronic change came over it; and these
streams grew more and more foul with weeds and
grotesque in stagnation, until I realized as if with an
awakening that they were full of tremendous fish,
pike perhaps, often perch, and hybrids of many
colours and streakings. These fish lay watching,
stretched from one bank to the other; their number,
my loneliness, their immensity, my fixity conspired
to frighten me unspeakably.</p>

<p>At other times the river was in flood, and I, as before,
compelled by the secret of the matter to walk along
its towpath, in danger of its torrents; the path itself
became unknown, or lay between two huge channels
choking with muddy torrents. Ever expecting the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>
worst, I was suddenly at an ancient mill, watching</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>Slow Lethe without coil,</p>
<p>Softly, like a stream of oil</p>
</div>

<p>gliding under the footbridge. This was sickly
phantasm, the very waters breathing decay. The
scene swiftly changed. Paddington! and you, dear
old friend C., racing with me across the metals to
catch a train, and&#8213; Then C. is in his grave again,
and I am in a trap outside my old home; a stranger
stands in the road, cuts his throat; I look on, smile,
and shudder, for he races after the trap with his
knife; but I outstare his Malayan eyes, and he
gives up the chase. By way of respite, I now walked
at leisure into a bookshop, and my hand fell upon
rarities indeed. <i>The Church</i>, by Leigh Hunt&#8211;I had
never seen that before! &#8220;We don&#8217;t have much time
for dinner,&#8221; said the bookseller, and I took the hint
and went out.</p>

<p>And there were other familiar scenes in this phase
of nightly alienation. On occasion, though I awoke
several times from a haunting, I fell asleep again to
return to it. Half-nonsense as these dreams were,
there was a persistent force about them. Here was
the battalion, expecting to be attacked. Its nerves,
and mine, were restive. The attack broke out farther
up the line, and we got off with a reaction almost
as unwelcome as a battle. Or I was in a town behind
the line, into which a number of very small round
gas-shells were falling; then, in the cattle-truck
for the front; presently, in the wild scenery of great
hills and deep curving ravines which I seemed to
know so well. (The entrenched ridges in the unnatural
light of the flares looked monstrous once.) I was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>
company commander; we were to be relieved; and,
God, what had I done? Begun to bring my men
out before the other crowd had come up! The mound
would be lost, I should be &#8220;for it.&#8221; The company
must be halted in the open; and so we waited for
the relief. It never came.</p>

<p>Still the dreams came: the war continued. S. S.
was with me, walking up a big cobbled road, muddy
as ever, towards the front. On every side lay
exhausted men, not caring whether they were in the
mud or not. I was not quite sure, but was not this
Poperinghe Station? At that station was&#8211;I hope
is&#8211;an hotel, bearing the legend, &#8220;Bifsteck à Toute
Heure&#8221;; was this gaudy-looking place, perhaps,
the same? At all events, S. S. said, &#8220;Let&#8217;s go and
have a port.&#8221; We did, and the drink appears to have
gone to my head, for I now found myself alone,
walking across a large common or pasture. Here
Mary and another woman went by, but I could not
at the moment recognize them. There, beyond the
common with its dry tussocks, stood a town, flanked
by mountains, which I knew to be&#8211;Barry. A
cathedral or abbey of white stone rose in gigantic
strength into the sunlight. This place, I soliloquized,
so near the line, and yet not shelled! But I was not
to escape. I proceeded. The screen alongside was
blown down. Better slink along these hedges at the
double! It was the support line. Some large
splinter-proof dugouts came into sight, and some
officers, who told me about an attack. We were
going over. I recognized my destined end.</p>

<p>However, I woke up alive, having again suffered
more from fear and the atmosphere of it&#8211;in projection&#8211;in
a few seconds, than I was ever conscious
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>
of suffering in a day of the actual war. With weary
and aching head, whether these fantasies were to
blame or not, I looked out to ask the wireless expert
if there had been a storm in the night. He grinned,
and going farther I saw outside a sea of pale glow
not a great deal more disturbed than a looking-glass.</p>

<p>The ashen whiteness soon gave place to a deep
blue, and our entry into the tropics became plainer
and plainer, the sea fluttering with the sun&#8217;s blaze.
This was unfamiliar also, to be roasting on the water
in January. The pith-helmet season began. The
third mate could not claim a pith helmet, but he
displayed what none of the others could, as he sat
washing on the step of the alleyway&#8211;a marvellous
red and blue serpent tattooed on his arm, by the
very Chinaman, he said, who had tattooed King
George. It was, I still think, a superfine serpent.</p>

<p>Washing, or &#8220;dobing,&#8221; was not Mead&#8217;s sole recreation.
Literature, and even poetry, with limitations,
had its power over him. Suspecting me of critical
curiosity about his favourite poets, he directly
approached the matter. Rudyard Kipling and &#8220;A
Sentimental Bloke&#8221; were satisfactory, but he couldn&#8217;t
bear the others who gave their views on love.
Lawrence Hope had done one or two good things&#8211;but
the rest, as Keats, Ella Wheeler Wilcox, and
so forth, might as well be cut out. His approval of
Kipling was confirmed by Meacock&#8217;s saying in the
saloon, where books and authors were a favourite
pabulum, &#8220;H&#8217;m&#8211;the third mate seems to be getting
very interested in Kipling. He brought me a paper
with all he could remember of <i>IF</i> written out on it,
and asked me if I could supply any of the rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>This literary halo aroused Bicker, who was already
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>
known to me as the ship&#8217;s poet, and had unfortunately
left his MSS. at home. He now urged his claims.
&#8220;The gardener called me Poet when I was about seven
or eight, and I often get called that now.&#8221; The
chief, chuckling, brought off his little joke. &#8220;I
suppose that&#8217;s what drove you to sea.&#8221;</p>

<p>In connection, no doubt, with poetry, that strange
device, the mate looked back to a ship in which he
once served, and which was chartered to carry the
largest whale ever caught in Japanese waters to
New York for the New York Museum. By whale,
he said he meant the skeleton, of course; but it
had been sketchily cleaned, &#8220;and when we got her
to New York,&#8221; he said with a comical frown, &#8220;nobody
could get near the hatches&#8221;: and, finding the sequence
easy, he added that there was often some peculiar
cargo on that New York-Hong Kong run&#8211;take
for instance those rows of dead Chinamen in the
&#8217;tween-deck homeward bound.</p>

<p>The face of the sky often held me delighted. There
is nothing, I think, of dullness about this world&#8217;s
weather; and its hues and tones may still be a sufficient
testing theme for the greatest artists with pen or
pencil. To express the sunset uprising of clouds,
many of them in semblance of towering ships under
full sail, many more like creatures mistily seen in
endless pastures, was an attempt in which my own
vocabulary scarcely lasted a moment. One evening,
the nonpareil of its race, especially &#8220;burned the
mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>At first the blue temple was hung with plumes of
cloud, golden feathers. When these at last were
grey, a rosy flush swiftly came along them, like a
thought, and passed. It seemed as though the night
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>
had come, when the loitering tinges of the rose in
a few seconds grew unutterably red, and the spectacle
was that of an aerial lattice or trellis among the
clouds, overgrown with the heavenly original of all
roses. &#8220;In Xanadu&#8213;&#8221; From brightness the
amassed cloud-bloom still increased to brightness:
then suddenly the flames turned to ember. Even now
again a ghost of themselves glowed, until all was gone,
and Sirius entered upon his tenancy of another glory,
and Orion and Canopus, casting a hoar-frost glimmer
ahead of the riding ship.</p>

<p>Hosea agreed this was a remarkable sunset; then
took me off to the friendly tot and talk in his room.
He loved to discuss all sorts of theory in art and
religion, of which he might have been, with a slight
change of circumstance in his boyhood, a student
and enthusiast: meanwhile, the sailor in him would
be rummaging through the makings of a curiosity
shop which crowded his official desk, besides the manifests
and ship&#8217;s articles&#8211;his watches, knives, coins
and notes of twenty countries, photographs of
friends all over the world.</p>

<p>The flying-fishes could have dispensed with the
<i>Bonadventure</i>. During the night, sixteen or so had
come aboard, to be seized by the apprentices for
breakfast; I saw with surprise how one had been
driven and wedged between the steam-pipes. In
looks, when they were out of their element, despite
their large mild eyes, their long &#8220;wings&#8221; closed
into a sort of spur, being light spines webbed with a
filmy skin, despite too the purple-blue glowing from
the dark back, they did not seem remarkable. But
under the hot and shining morning, where the <i>Bonadventure&#8217;s</i>
sheering bows alarmed the shoals into
flight, they were seen more justly. In ones and twos
and crescents and troops they skimmed away, sometimes
with their dark backs and white undersides
appearing as fishes, sometimes in the sun nothing
more than volleys of light-curved silvery darts.
They turned in the air at sharp angles without
apparently losing their speed, which was such that
often one heard the water hiss as they entered it
again.</p>

<p>The morning that they first came in numbers, it
happened that the salt fish for breakfast was relieved
by reminiscences.</p>

<p>&#8220;You reminded me of Captain Shank just now,
chief.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed&#8211;why?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>&#8220;When you ran your hand along the table for
the treacle.... He used to think the treacle was
put aboard for him. He told the second mate off
for eating too much of it&#8211;said it wasn&#8217;t really for
his use. After that we all began to eat the stuff like
blazes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must have had some funny captains in this
line.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was. He&#8217;d come up sometimes on the bridge
and sit down in the wheel and start making noises
to himself. He&#8217;d sit there with his old chin drooping
and say, &#8217;... I knew it.... Haw, haw....
The silly old b&#8213;.... Bless my soul....&#8217; for
twenty minutes. I&#8217;d go away from the wheel for
fear of laughing out&#8211;and then he&#8217;d go somewhere
else and do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Davy Jones got him at the finish, didn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8211;And a dam&#8217;d fine ship too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was her maiden trip.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What happened to her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ran ashore.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Both the boats capsized.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She had the most valuable cargo I ever heard of.&#8221;
A pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Old Shank used to ask for it, though. Once in
the Gulf of Mexico he was down below, and the ship
was on the course he&#8217;d given. (He never used to
take any notice of deviation.) The second mate
heard breakers, you could hear them quite plain,
and not very far off; so he turns the ship a little, and
goes down to tell Shank. Old Shank jumped up
and stormed and stamped, and rushed up on the
bridge roaring, &#8217;<i>Am I to be taught after forty-eight
years at sea by a set of b&#8213; schoolboys?</i>&#8217; and had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>
her put back to the old course again. And then he
walked off. You could hear him snapping his teeth.
Presently he stopped. You could see the breakers
now, the phosphorescence of them. &#8217;<i>What&#8217;s that?</i>&#8217;
he whipped out, &#8217;<i>What&#8217;s that?</i> My God.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was one of the white-haired boys in the
office, what&#8217;s more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His officers saved him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, one night he gave me a course, and the
last thing he said to me on the bridge was, &#8216;It&#8217;s up to
you to keep her there.&#8217; I soon found we were going
to fall on land, and I changed the course. And as
it was, we passed three-quarters of a mile inside the
lightship. I went down to his room and told him.
&#8216;Why, you damn&#8217;d fool,&#8217; he started off; he nearly went
mad. &#8216;But I&#8217;ve hauled her out,&#8217; I said, &#8216;I hauled her
out.&#8217; And then he yelled, &#8216;Changed her course
without orders, did you?&#8217; and so on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the office made a pet of him. Some people
get away with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;After my trip with him, the whole crew refused
to sail with him again. And the mate went up to
Shields to join a new ship. And when he got there,
he found Shank had joined her as skipper!&#8221;</p>

<p>We came into the Doldrums, and I felt none too
well. &#8220;Cold, worse; heat, worse,&#8221; became my
diary&#8217;s keynote. The steward also complained of a
persistent cold. Six bottles&#8211;six&#8211;of his own medicine
since we left Barry had not cured him. This
notable Cardiff Irishman was always pleased to
answer questions about this cold of his, and they
became suspiciously frequent. Then his solemn face
would grow still more solemn, his voice of office
would take on a pleasing melancholy, and he would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>
shake his grey head with dolorous realizations.
Nevertheless, his stores being just below my cabin,
I grew accustomed to his morning rejuvenate roarings
from the threshold at the avarice of the modern
sailor. It seemed that at such times he was momentarily
free of his illness.</p>

<p>He, nevertheless, at present, added his good word to
the general approval of the cook. The bread was
universally admired, the pea-soup also. This popularity
did not cause any alteration in the melancholy
orientalism of its deserver. He looked forth from
his galley with the same wooden countenance. He
was the thinnest man I think I ever saw.</p>

<p>His macaroni, however, appeared to fall under a
general taboo. It was &#8220;eschewed.&#8221; Bicker, the
most assiduous tale-teller, seized it as the chance for
describing an old shipmate&#8217;s misfortune. It was in
Italy: &#8220;He was keen on seeing all the sights, so we
asked him if he&#8217;d seen the macaroni plantation. He
said he&#8217;d like to. We told him to take the tram out
of the town and walk on another mile or so, when
he&#8217;d see the trees with macaroni growing on them
like lace&#8211;natural lace. And he went. But the best
of it was that he&#8217;d sent a card home the day before
to say, &#8216;To-morrow I am going to see the macaroni
plantation.&#8217;&#8221; This, which if true was stranger than
fiction, elicited recollections of fool&#8217;s-errands in the
shipyards (&#8220;Run and get a capful of nailholes,&#8221;
&#8220;Ask the storekeeper for a brass hook and a long
stay&#8221;), which kept us at table until the steward
groaned aloud.</p>

<p>I led a lazy life. There was not much reason for
being active. My afternoon walk might reach as
far as the fo&#8217;c&#8217;sle, in which lay a kindly miscellany
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>
of wire, hemp and manila ropes in coils, and an aroma
of paint and tar was never absent. The heat, however,
seemed intenser in this house than in the open.
Clouds and a little rain soon vanished, and the sea
was one long flame towards the sun. White uniforms
were in vogue. For me, the half-closed eye, with a
flying-fish or two sometimes glittering to awake its
notice, in any corner out of the sun, was an occupation.
The unfortunate boatswain and his men were
chipping paint, clanging and banging in the heat; or
I would see him perching on the bulwarks directing
some aerial operation, and a sailor seated in the
&#8220;bosun&#8217;s chair&#8221; being hauled up the mast. They
rested from Saturday noon until Monday morning.
Now, more than ever, the lot of the engineers and
firemen seemed unacceptable. The blaze, the fierce
blue sea, and a flagging breeze became a routine now.
The rains of the Doldrums were not much in evidence;
a short shower, flying over the clay-coloured water,
might come towards evening.</p>

<p>Incidents were few. The sight of the flying-fishes
still starting up and skimming, veering and spurting
into a safe distance from the intruder, was no longer
one for my absorbed watch. I woke up, heavy-headed,
one morning to find that Meacock had suspended
one of these poor creatures from my roof;
there he hung swaying in the little breeze that there
was, in parched and doleful manner, and ever and
anon turning upon me, who felt much in his condition,
his mild and magnificent eye. I threw him out with
sympathy. At night the boobies shrieked round the
lights on the masts, and appeared at morning flying
over the water. Once the sleep of the just was
broken by profane language and scuffling in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>
passage outside&#8211;a rat hunt. Boat drill took its
turn one afternoon, the siren summoning all hands
available to their posts. I was questioned about
Colonel Lawrence, at intervals, having seen him in
the flesh; and the publisher of his <i>Life</i> was expected
to be named by me. I said that I believed he himself
would write his Memoirs. But this was not the
thing. A book about him by some one who knew
how to paint the lily and improve on possibility was
what was sought. I think I could design a satisfactory
coloured cover.</p>

<p>The morning bucket was a transient happiness.
To disturb the &#8220;gradual dusky veil&#8221; now unescapable,
since the bunkers were now chiefly filled
with coal-dust, was not too simple in a limited space,
with limited hot water. My porthole, looking over
those fuming bunkers, had to be shut at all hours.
According to everybody, the <i>Bonadventure</i> was &#8220;a
dirty ship&#8221;; although it seemed unlikely that a
carrier of coal by thousands of tons should be clean.</p>

<p>She at least began to please the chief with his
coveted &#8220;Ten knots&#8221;; and at dinner on the seventeenth
day out, he asked whether anyone had seen
a disturbance in the water. The old gentleman was
expected. I was sorry that he did not come, after
all, with his &#8220;baptism,&#8221; shave, and medicine (and
I believe other rites), when at about four in the
afternoon the <i>Bonadventure</i> crossed the Equator;
but old customs can scarcely be eternal. The
steward&#8217;s cough mixture was the only medicine I
got that day. Neptuneless, the ship furrowed a
sea almost silent, and evening came on tranquilly
among woolpacks of warm-kindled colouring.</p>

<p>Mary, what news?&#8211;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lands, as I suppose,</p>
<p>Are drenched with sleet or drifted up with snows,</p>
<p>The east wind strips the slates and starves the blood,</p>
<p>Or thaws and rains make life a sea of mud.</p>
<p>You close each door, draw armchairs nigh the fire,</p>
<p>But draughts sneak in and make you draw &#8217;em nigher&#8211;</p>
<p>No matter: still they come: play parlour gales</p>
<p>And whisk about their hyperboreal tails;</p>
<p>Bed&#8217;s the one hope, and scarcely tried before</p>
<p>Next morning&#8217;s postman thunders at the door.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Meanwhile&#8211;if I may gently hint&#8211;I wear</p>
<p>But scanty clothes, though all the sun will bear;</p>
<p>A red-hot sun smiles on a hot blue sea</p>
<p>And leaves my bunk to laziness and me:</p>
<p>I read, until a lethargy ensues,</p>
<p>Tales of detectives frowning over clues</p>
<p>And last month&#8217;s papers; then the strain&#8217;s too strong,</p>
<p>Man wants but little, nor that little long,</p>
<p>The deck-chair in the shadow now appeals,</p>
<p>Until the next hash-hammer rings to meals.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>But not alone in climate may I claim</p>
<p>Advantage; while you feel the slings of fame,</p>
<p>Beset at all hours by the shapes of those</p>
<p>Who volunteer your wants to diagnose,</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span>Who come with merchandise and go with cheques;</p>
<p>No licensed interrupter haunts these decks,</p>
<p>No vans of wares along these highways clatter.</p>
<p>None urges to insure, buy broom or platter.</p>
<p>There is no sheaf of letters every day,</p>
<p>Regretting, and so forth: no minstrel&#8217;s lay:</p>
<p>Proofs, none: reminders, none&#8211;while daily you,</p>
<p>Poor creature, tear your hair and struggle through,</p>
<p>And darken paper till you light the lamps,</p>
<p>And the last shilling disappears in stamps.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Nor weightier cares you lack, it is decreed;</p>
<p>The clock won&#8217;t go, the chickens will not feed,</p>
<p>The pump, always a huffy ancient, swears,</p>
<p>&#8220;Water? if you wants water, try elsewheres&#8221;:</p>
<p>The infant wonder, she who must inquire,</p>
<p>Investigates herself into the fire,</p>
<p>The playful snowball whizzes through the pane,</p>
<p>In brief, you try to kick the cat: in vain.</p>
<p>Here no such troubles blot the almanac</p>
<p>For me; no day is marked with red or black:</p>
<p>Events&#8211;eventicles&#8211;are few, as these,</p>
<p>The sighted school of bobbing porpoises,</p>
<p>The flying-fish when first I saw them leap</p>
<p>And flash like swallows over the blue deep;</p>
<p>The rose-red sunset, or the Sunday duff,</p>
<p>Or&#8211;but enumeration cries &#8220;Enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>There is no Mary in the Atlantic, true,</p>
<p>Nor cellared bookshop to be foraged through.</p>
<p>But as I said, at least I&#8217;ve found the sun</p>
<p>And idle times&#8211;even this will soon be done;</p>
<p>A corner where no rags-and-bones apply,</p>
<p>Nor postman comes, nor poultry droop and die.</p>

<p>The South-East Trade was blowing fresh next day,
if a damp clammy rush of hot air deserves the term.
The threatened heavy rains of the Doldrums had not
come; the heavy heat subdued talk at table. Cloud
and sultry steamy haze had hung about us during
the morning; at two or thereabouts the first land
seen by the <i>Bonadventure</i> since her first day&#8217;s stubborn
entry into the English Channel came into view.
My view was at first none at all; but encouraged by
Bicker and with his glasses I could make out the
island of Fernando Noronha, twenty miles away to
the south-east. A tall peak and the high ground
about it for a space gave the illusion of some great
cathedral, a Mont St. Michel seen by Cotman faintly
forthshadowed; then, the willing fancy rebuked, I
discerned its low coasts of rock, inhospitable and mist-haunted.</p>

<p>This singular crag breaking out of the
mid-ocean, I knew, was a convict settlement. &#8220;Life
sentences&#8221; were safely mewed up here. At length
we were abeam of this melancholy place, while the
sun seemed to make a show of its white prison camp,
at a distance of twelve or thirteen miles. It would
have been hard not to imagine the despair of men
condemned to such a prison. The peak&#8217;s stern
finger might have struck with awe the first navigators
to approach it. To see the immutable pillar in every
sunset and at every sunrise, surveying all the drudgery,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>
the emblem of perpetual soullessness, must be
an unnerving punishment. The constant processions
of ships, to whom Fernando Noronha is a welcome
mark, with their smoke vanishing swiftly to north or
south, could scarcely tantalize more?</p>

<p>The rough overhanging pinnacle faded again, and
evening fell. Leaning with the third mate over the
bridge canvas, while the moon, now waxing, riding
through the frontiers of a black cloud, cast a dim
avenue over the sea, and from other dishevelled
clouds a few quiet drops came down, was a most
peaceful luxury. About the bows the water was lit
up by sudden flashes gone too soon. These travelling
lights&#8211;akin to the gem of the glow-worm seen close&#8211;were,
according to Mead, the Portugee men-of-war
which I had seen by day. No name could be less
descriptive. These small creatures, at night living
lamps of green, by day with their glassy red and blue
like the floating petals of some sea-rose, were worthy
of some gentler imagist. When, Mead said, you
take them from the water, they are nothing but a
little slime; evanescent as the rainbow on the
spray.</p>

<p>Splendour and fiery heat marked the day still. I
had discarded jacket and socks, enjoying the soothing
gush of air about the ankles; otherwise even reading
was made unprofitable by the drug-like heat. The
same sky and seascape, the same condemnations of
&#8220;a dirty ship&#8221; recurred day by day. &#8220;The worst
ship I ever sailed on, mister. You turn in washed
and you wake up black.&#8221; The bath was still an
enjoyable interlude, despite mechanical drawbacks.
The bath proper was out of order, owing tosome
deficiency of the water-pipes. At one end, in substitution,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>
you lodged your bucket in a board with a
hole in it. At the other end a crossbar offered the
bather a seat. Much splashing transferred the water
from the bucket to your coal-dust surface; while,
there being little air in the bathroom, you breathed
sparingly. Yet how well off was the acrobat with
his sponge, compared with the fireman who just then
was taking bucket after bucket of ashes from the
stokehold hoist and tipping them overboard&#8211;a job
that was never done until the engines rested in port;
that punctuated our progress, as did the morning
hosepipe on the cabins and the bridge deck.</p>

<p>Not much was said of the country to which we were
going. Englishmen were definitely unpopular there,
said some one; English sailors, on the slightest pretext,
taken off by the police to the &#8220;calaboosh.&#8221; &#8220;You
only want to look like an Englishman.&#8221; &#8220;Well,
what about trying to look like a German?&#8221; The
chief engineer rarely missed a chance to rub in his
politics, and he jumped at this one&#8211;&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t the
same thing apply at home?&#8221;&#8211;with eager irony.</p>

<p>Ships were discussed and compared at almost
every meal. Some, luxurious.</p>

<p>&#8220;But that yacht she was pretty, there&#8217;s no getting
away from it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was <i>my</i> yacht.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They must employ quite a lot of shore labour to
keep these yachts from looking like ships.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, they couldn&#8217;t very well make them look
like standard ships, if they wanted to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217; know&#8211;get the second mate and the
chief to co-operate&#8211;saw off the funnel halfway, and
throw a few ashes about the decks.&#8221;</p>

<p>Some, ideal.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>&#8220;She looked just like the model of a ship&#8211;and
she was spotless.&#8221;</p>

<p>Some, not what they ought to be.</p>

<p>&#8220;I looked and saw her name, <i>The Duke of York</i>.
I thought to myself, I&#8217;ll write to him and tell him
about the state of his namesake. She looked like a
wreck.&#8221;</p>

<p>Some, again, like the <i>Bonadventure</i>, standard ships,
the hasty replacements of submarine wastage. The
criticism here, of course, had the severity of domestic
familiarity.</p>

<p>&#8220;They have these ships made in one piece at the
shipyard. When they want one, they just cut off a
length, and join the ends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I say the man who designed this ship ought
to have designed another and pegged out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mister, she&#8217;s a dirty ship.&#8221;</p>

<p>I detected&#8211;it was not difficult&#8211;a vague prejudice
against wireless. The wireless operator was foolish
enough to have at his fingers&#8217; ends all the tabular
details of shipping companies and their vessels, and
to display this dry knowledge in the middle of his
seniors&#8217; recollections. His seafaring experience, it
may be mentioned, was altogether recent, and among
the elders he would have done better <i>not</i> to know.
It was of course impersonally aired, this prejudice
against wireless. First, there was the view that as
ships had hitherto, beginning with the Ark, gone to
sea without the invention, they could continue to do
so. Then, the fact that wireless might save life
admitted, the system current was decried. It seemed
that the merchant ships of over 1,600 tons carried
wireless operators and sets, but that one operator
to a ship was the allowance; now one operator
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>
watched eight hours out of the twenty-four, and all
were off duty at the same time. So it was believed.
&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing in the Bible,&#8221; the critic would
urge, &#8220;to say a ship mustn&#8217;t be wrecked when all
the operators are off duty.&#8221;</p>

<p>I had expected music&#8211;chanteys, or at least
accordions&#8211;aboard a merchantman; but very little
was that expectation justified. There had been a
gramophone (and step-dancing), but it was out of
action after one evening&#8217;s protracted use. It was
not often, yet, that I had heard even a whistled
scrap; occasionally the coloured firemen would sing
in falsetto.</p>

<p>An epidemic of hair-cutting broke out. Every
time I saw the process going on, the artist was a
fresh one; and I was inclined to think that we are a
nation of hair-cutters. Among the practitioners, the
cook, with his usual severe expression, plied a neat pair
of scissors. It was a scene which reminded me of old
trench life. I thought of a close support trench
opposite Auchy, about the month of June, 1916,
where a sickly programme of sniping by field guns,
rifle grenades, &#8220;pineapples,&#8221; and incredible escapes
from them did not prevent my being shorn by the
steadiest of amateurs. With what outward intrepidity
I sat there!</p>

<p>At the captain&#8217;s request, the cook advanced to cut
his hair. That done, he cut mine. Venturing to
talk, I was soon exchanging sallies of the British
Expeditionary Force, for he had been thereof, a
tunneller. Of his being in a countermined shaft at
the wrong moment at Vimy, and his luck in being
dragged out by the sergeant-major, he gave some
details; but the first evident attack of mirth to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>
which I had ever seen him give way came as he mused
over rations supplied by the French for a fortnight
at St. Quentin under some temporary arrangement.
&#8220;Wine, beans, and b&#8213; horseflesh,&#8221; he said,
<i>staccato</i>, and with a dry laugh like the rattling of
beans. &#8220;First we&#8217;d all get bound up and then
we&#8217;d all get diarrh&oelig;a. Oh, it was the hell of a go.&#8221;
&#8220;There,&#8221; he said, leaving a little tuft over my forehead,
&#8220;you&#8217;ll still be able to have a couple of quiffs
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was not only cook and hairdresser off duty, I
found: he was given to sketching portraits. I went
once or twice to talk with him in the galley, where
the heat was enough to make the famous Lambert
himself turn thin. And his work, he pointed out,
was continuous, with his assistant&#8217;s services; he had
to put up double meals to suit the watches. &#8220;But
why do I stick it?&#8221; he said, taking a batch of bread
from the oven and standing it on end against the
others. &#8220;A man can stick shore jobs all right when
there&#8217;s five mouths depending on him. There&#8217;s not
a lot of shore jobs now.&#8221;</p>

<p>His drawings were done in the little corner where
he and his mate had their bunks. They were pictures
of ladies and seamen of his acquaintance; crude,
with lips of a bitter redness, and cheeks faintly pink,
staring and disproportioned, yet done with such
pains, such strivings after &#8220;likeness,&#8221; that when he
requested me to help him to a post as artist to <i>The
Times</i>, I much wished that I could! I had no sooner
made the acquaintance of the cook&#8217;s portraits than a
poem was bashfully brought to me by its author,
Bicker. I must say that, although his lines had
occasionally been eked out with last resorts, there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>
was a heartiness about them which I liked; and,
going down presently to his cabin, I got him to show
me more. He had already written several rhyming
epistles during the trip, which with the retiring instinct
of poets he had left to blush unseen. So we
had aboard among a crew of forty or so a painter of
portraits and a writer of verse.</p>

<p>We had our philosopher too, Phillips, the chief
engineer, veteran of Khartoum, master of machinery,
physician less active but more reliable than the
steward; but above all, the Diogenes&#8211;with a slush-lamp.
His philosophy might be no ill store about
this time, when in the heat the pitch melted from
the seams of his cabin roof and mottled his bed, as
he put it: a circumstance not yet mentioned in
sonnets wooing tardy sleep, and which of course
called upon that nimble sixpence of <i>Bonadventure</i>
conversation, &#8220;She <i>is</i> a dirty ship.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span><a id='link_11'></a>XI</h2>

<p>A note of a train of thought forced upon me hereabouts
may find a place here, as it was set down.</p>

<p>(<i>Feb. 4.</i>) It was nothing more nor less than the
appearance at dinner to-day of a bully stew and a
sort of ration lime juice, which drove my thoughts,
always willing to be driven in that direction, towards
a nervous period of 1916, my initiation into trench
warfare. The meal was something of a facsimile;
and soon after it, by a coincidence, I was sitting under
the scissors of a volunteer barber much as once after
such a dinner I sat in the alleyway by company headquarters,
opposite the red roofs of Auchy. The
<i>Bonadventure&#8217;s</i> bridge, I meditated as I endured the
shears of a B.E.F. man again, looked not unlike those
so-called &#8220;communication trenches&#8221; in the Richebourg
district, those make-believes; and, as the
steam-valve suddenly made me jump with its thudding
volley of minor explosions, I experienced an echo
of the ancient terrors in those same scantily covered
ways when cross-firing machine-guns opened upon
my working-party.</p>

<p>The lime juice, in the present case, was of a milder
disposition than that to which we were accustomed.
Yet there was perceptible in it that uncivilized
strength which proved it to come of the same honest
origin. We were, I must confess&#8211;it is not too
late&#8211;much lacking in our appreciation of that uncompromising,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>
biting liquid which circulated in the
trenches, carried in jars which should have been, it
was felt, carrying rum. In itself a sort of candid
friend, that lime juice lacked advancement through
faults not its own. I mean, there was the chlorinated
water, which for all its virtues was hardly popular,
and there was the sugar, which was half-and-half,
associating, very friendly, with tea dust. Moreover,
this same <i>sugar</i>, in its nocturnal progress at the
bottom of a sandbag, while its carrier now stepped
into an artificial lake and now lay down for the
bullets of Quinque Jimmy to pass by unimpeded,
had acquired an interspersion of hairy particles; as
generally did our loaves of bread, which in some
cases might easily be supposed to be wearing wigs.
In this manner, the germ-destroyer, the intrusion of
tea dust and the moulted coat of sandbags, combined
to prevent the lime juice, like crabbed poet, &#8220;from
being as generally tasted as he deserved to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>At Company Headquarters, too, there was often
in those easy times a rival beverage. Here and there
a messenger might be sent back to an estaminet and
return to the war with comforts within a couple of
hours.</p>

<p>Yet I myself did my best to cultivate the &#8220;lime-juice
habit,&#8221; and to me it remains an integral part
of the interiors, gone but not forgotten, of many a
Rotten Row in the Béthune Sectors. I see its gloomy
and mottled surface, in the aluminium tumbler,
besides my platter of &#8220;meat and vegetable&#8221; or (as
to-day) of bully rehabilitated by the smoky cooks;
and about me the shape of the lean-to dugout rises
sufficiently high for a tall man to enter without going
on all fours. Here, is the earth settee, running
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>
round three sides of the table, there, the glory hole
in which, one at a time, we crawl to sleep, with a
fine confused bedding of British Warms and sandbags.
The purple typescript of <i>Comic Cuts</i>,<a id='FNanchor_1'></a><a href='#Footnote_1' class='fnanchor'><sup>[1]</sup></a> in which
what imagination and telescope has striven to reveal
of the &#8220;other fellow,&#8221; mind, body and soul, is set
in military prose, flaps neglectedly from its nail. In
their furious tints, the ladies of the late Kirchner
beam sweetly upon him who sets put on patrol and
him who returns; while in the convenient niches
between the walls and the corrugated iron roof above,
which as a protection might perhaps amount to the
faith of the ostrich, Mills bombs and revolvers and
ammunition nestle.</p>

<p>There, given the noise of shells travelling over,
trench mortar bombs dropping short, machine guns
firing high&#8211;or of shells alighting abruptly on the
parados, trench mortar bombs thundering into the
next traverse, machine guns in spitfire temper
stripping the top layer of sandbags&#8211;the boyish
gay P. would with his subalterns pore over the
maps, receive with sinking heart the ominous &#8220;secret
and confidential&#8221; and &#8220;very secret&#8221; messages
brought in by those fine youths the runners; fill in,
not without murmurings, those <i>pro forma&#8217;s</i> which
at one time seemed likely to turn fighting into clerkship, or &#8220;censor&#8221; those
long pages of homely scrawl in copying pencil which were to keep up yet a day
more the spirits of sweethearts, mothers and wives.</p>

<p>Thus the particular memories of trenches and our
times and seasons in them, roused by such a light
matter as this which has aroused them now, pass
with the greatest emotion before the mind. It is not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>
fashionable to talk of the war. Is the counsel, then,
to follow the Psalmist:</p>

<div class='bquote'>
<p>I said, I will take heed to my ways: that I offend not
in my tongue....</p>

<p>I held my tongue, and spake nothing. I kept silence,
yea, even from good words; but it was pain and grief
to me.</p>
</div> <!-- block quote -->

<p>One has not to follow him very long in that.</p>

<div class='bquote'>
<p>My heart was hot within me, and while I was thus
musing the fire kindled: and at the last I spake with my
tongue.</p>
</div> <!-- block quote -->

<p>One wonders, though, how the Psalmist himself,
had he been one of us, would have found means to
communicate his strange undertones of experience,
according to their significance for himself? To whom
would it be of interest, if he described such a particle
as St. Vaast Keep on the Richebourg road, though
he saw daily again in some odd way its sandbagged
posts with the fine wood panels from the shell-like
house beside built in?&#8211;seen once, for a lifetime.
Or Port Arthur, that wreckage of a brewery near
Neuve Chapelle&#8211;why should every yard of its flimsy
fortification be coexistent with me? I could lead the
hearer through its observation-posts, its emplacements,
its warrens for human beings, its relics of
other days, with practical and geographical accuracy;
but the words would not contain my own sense of
the place, which from the very first I never needed
nor endeavoured to put into words. And yet it is
intense and instant. The reflection of the crazy
stronghold as it was, and with what it meant for me,
comes in a second when my thoughts lie that way,
and it is but one of a series of equal insistency. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>
is no question, this, of looking back on such a past
as in any degree glorious, of shirking the anguish that
overcast any adventurous gleam that these scenes
awakened. Their memory is as sombre and as
frightening as they were themselves in their aspect
and their annals.</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>They come unbidden,</p>
</div>

<p>and when they will come, the mind is led by them as
birds are said to be lured by the serpent&#8217;s eye. A
tune, a breath of sighing air, an odour&#8211;and there
goes the foolish ghost back to Flanders.</p>

<p>Even here, I suppose, in the Atlantic&#8217;s healthy
blue, I am at the mercy of a coincidence in lime-juice.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span><a id='link_12'></a>XII</h2>

<p>Following a roaster of day, with a slack wind astern
covering the deck forward with showers of cinders
like shot, I admired the moonlight and the sweet
night air before I turned in to sleep soundly. I woke
thinking I heard the usual swabbing of decks beginning,
but this was incorrect. It was quite dark,
and I began to think with gratitude of a second
innings of sleep; but when I looked at my watch it
was after seven. The din of water outside, mingled
with the rushing of a mighty wind, persuaded me to
go to the door. In a few moments the storm was at
its height, the sea shrouded in a thick deluge almost
to the ship&#8217;s side, and its waves beaten down by the
rain into pallid foam-veined inertia. An ashen grey
light was about us, but the clouds of rain veiled the
poop from one&#8217;s eyes amidships, and the siren
trumpeted out its warnings; while sheet-like lightning
flamed through the vapours, and bursts of deeper
thunder than I had ever heard followed hard upon
them. The decks were racing with water from overhead
covers and stairways, and in each lifting of the
storm the awning over the sailors&#8217; quarters aft could
be seen tearing at its tethers.</p>

<p>This fury soon slackened, and green and blue, pale
as yet, returned to the seas as they leapt away from
the bows. Breakfast intervened. Attention was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>
requested from the storm by the appearance of a
new and experimental kind of ham.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. What d&#8217;ye think of the ham&#8211;tinned boneless
smoked ham?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I like it well enough; but it&#8217;s boneless.
If you take the bone away from ham, you take
away the nature of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>This ham later on became much esteemed, but the
ingenious mind was for dissembling the fact: &#8220;We&#8217;d
better not give a too enthusiastic report on it or they&#8217;ll
only give it to the passenger boats&#8221; of the same
company.</p>

<p>It was blowing still, from the coast of South
America. &#8220;Smell the mould?&#8221; asked Hosea, and
I did; a strange frightening fragrance, of the earth
earthy, a heavy and swooning smell. It was so
strong as to puzzle Bicker even, in his watch; and
its most unpleasant manifestation caused him to
look about for the carcass of a rat on the bridge deck.</p>

<p>We had come by this time into a highway of ships.
The first that passed us, a small steamer, was not
much noticed; nor the next, which passed in the
night. &#8220;Her lamp gave a blink and then went out,&#8221;
said Bicker, and wished he could have emulated a
mate of his acquaintance who likewise signalled
to a passer-by in vain. &#8220;If you damn&#8217;d foreigners
can&#8217;t answer,&#8221; he sent out as she came alongside
presently, &#8220;why the hell don&#8217;t you keep out of
sight? Good night!&#8221; But, on being pressed, he
admitted that the &#8220;foreigner&#8221; replied: &#8220;Thank
you. And you&#8217;re a lady.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, however, another ship belonging to the
same company with the <i>Bonadventure</i> was seen afar
through the afternoon. As the two drew level,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>
ceremony took place. The houseflag was dipped
and raised and dipped again by both; the red ensign
was dipped; and the homeward-bound sounded her
monosyllable three times, to which our own whistle
replied in equal number. This, as old-fashioned a
courtesy as could be wished, excited several others
aboard the <i>Bonadventure</i> besides the tyro; and as
the chief engineer began his tea, he thus referred
to the prevailing spirit.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8211;Well, so we passed one of <i>our</i> ships again to-day!
I was lying in my hammock asleep, when the
mess-room boy came running up, panting out: &#8216;Sir,
here&#8217;s one of our ships!&#8217; And I mumbled out something
like, &#8216;All right, John, there&#8217;s room enough for us
to pass, isn&#8217;t there?&#8217; Everybody was seemingly out on
deck, peering up at the mate to see if he had forgotten
the flags; everybody was staring at the funnel
with the eye of expectancy, wondering &#8216;When the
hell&#8217;s that damn&#8217;d whistle going?&#8217;&#8211;I didn&#8217;t get up
for it. I suppose that&#8217;s equivalent to contempt of
court or high treason.&#8221;</p>

<p>The bland face of the sage lighted up with pleasure
as he carefully gave us this impression of his.</p>

<p>After the storm, the air was thunder-heavy all
that day. Great dragon-flies, and butterflies in sultry
brown and red, and that must have been borne out
to sea on the strong breeze, were fluttering over the
decks and the water. At night, there was abundant
lightning in the distance: most of all on the eastern
horizon, with its world of waters, the flashes were of
a dusky redness, and of vague mountainous outline.
They came fast and furious, until the moon at last
seemed to overawe such wild carouse, and in good
earnest to govern the night; while in a deep blue
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>
darkness, among the folds of white cloud, stars shone
with new clearness. Under this celestial content,
the <i>Bonadventure</i> moved over a gleaming sea.</p>

<p>Mead, on his watch, was troubled. He sought in
his mind a life better paid and more exciting. Every
few moments, he would add some detail aloud to a
scheme for piracy in these waters, which he thought
might be made a profitable occupation. He pictured
a coaster, duly registered, running with ordinary
cargo to and fro, but on the lines of a &#8220;Q&#8221; boat, a
sort of marine wolf in sheep&#8217;s clothing, armed with
torpedo tubes. In all respects, himself being already
chosen as captain, its crew should form a co-operative
society. The pirate should carry a wireless installation
of the noisiest sort. In brief, the whole scheme
appealed to him so warmly that he was ready, apart
from details to be arranged, especially a financier,
to put it into practice. Me he would accept as purser,
not so much because I showed any promise as a
book-keeper, as that I had been in an infantry
battalion in the Line.</p>

<p>The ship was slowing down, and the chief was
worried. One morning he offered me employment,
&#8220;cleaning the tubes. You come round to my place.&#8221;
I went round at about nine, when the ship&#8217;s engines
were stopped, and found that he had as ever been
amusing himself in his quiet way. He himself, with
the firemen, was now ready to act as the ship&#8217;s
chimney-sweeps. After a full morning&#8217;s work, masked
in sweat and soot, they came up on deck again from
the job. I did not regret my earlier &#8220;disappointment.&#8221;
Relieved of the clogging soot, the <i>Bonadventure</i>
ran with fresh speed, against a tough head
wind. For the first time for some days, one heard
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>
the harsh drumming of the excess of steam escaping
through its valve. The wind drove the water, hereabouts
of a jade green colour, into long waves and
their fine manes of spray, upon which the sun made
many a small and fleeting rainbow. With this head
wind piping, and the cargo, it seemed, having shifted
lately, the ship had an uncomfortable list to port
and swayed as she went. &#8220;Here, you,&#8221; cried
Meacock to me, &#8220;your extra weight on the port
side&#8217;s doing this.&#8221; &#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s perfectly plain he is
the Jonah of the voyage.&#8221;</p>

<p>A dozen big black birds appeared as travelling
companions, white-breasted and easy-going. At a
closer view, I found that they were not properly black
but of that dingy russet grey towards which old
mushrooms grow. They seemed never to clap their
wings, but sailed as our gulls do on the wind, wheeling
and looping with a leisurely grace, and patrolling
the sea as closely as an owl beats a meadow without
wetting a wing-tip.</p>

<p>Nor was this the only token of our nearing our
first destination. Shore-going suits and boots were
out in the sun already. The steward&#8217;s usual attitude
became that of a priest, as he carried the captain&#8217;s
suits gingerly here and there.</p>

<p>But there was still time for trouble. A relapse in
the sainted manner of the old fellow occurred one
day at breakfast. The most tremendous roarings,
himself and the offending donkeyman in turn or in
chorus, suddenly broke out, and ended in the steward&#8217;s
ascent with a complaint to Hosea. Then, one evening,
after my quiet enjoyment of the pure blue sky after
a shower, with its Southern Cross and the false cross
and other stars strange to me glittering marvellously
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>
keen, I went in to my cabin to write, when I
instantly perceived something in the air. A most
pungent aroma, indeed, had been instilled through
the house; and going to inquire I found Cyrano of
Cardiff kneeling on the saloon floor, applying a
special kind of red paint. Properly, he said, it was
used for the keels of ships. I thought too that that
was its proper application.</p>

<p>At dinner, too, events took a serious turn. When
I had in previous days heard spaghetti hailed as
Wind-pipes, for instance, I had realized the phrase
as a humorous hyperbole. But now the tinned meat
problem presented itself to me in a more sinister
light&#8211;I was not so sure! There before me was a
godless lump of briny red fat and stringy appendages
floating more or less in a thick brown liquid which
demanded the spectacles of optimism. A reinforcement
of stony beans did not mend the matter. The
meat, as it fell out, wore a portion of skin, remarkable
for prickly excrescences, and hinting that I was
about to batten on the relics of a young porcupine, or
at least peculiar pork. Presently I asked Meacock
what sort of flesh this was. He answered: &#8220;O Lord,
<i>I</i> don&#8217;t know&#8211;it&#8217;s&#8211;well, I don&#8217;t think you can get
beyond tinned <i>meat</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another incident affected the administration. An
apprentice, whose stature brought him, beyond the
chance of escape, the nickname Little Tich, and who
was generally being bantered by someone or other,
was cleaning the brasswork of the compass in the
wheel-house. Meacock went in to take a bearing.
The bearing he got nonplussed him, and he got Mead
to try. Mead also found the needle giving strange
evidence. Suddenly it dawned upon them that its
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>
delusion was due to a tremendous dagger worn by
the very small and keenly occupied Tich.</p>

<p>The <i>Bonadventure</i> maintained her mended pace,
and also her awkward list, which conspired with a
strong swell; thus it was that the &#8220;fiddle&#8221; so
necessary to the safety of cups and plates in the Bay
of Biscay reappeared at this late stage. The nights
were beautiful, with their white moon and moonlight
far over the water, their stars, few, and of the moon&#8217;s
glowing whiteness, the light veilings of cloud blown
in silence about the sky, and little else heard except
the subdued measure of the ship&#8217;s engines, the
lapping repulse of waves from the bows, and the
sharp call of birds ahead and astern. Well might
Mead be glad of his roving temperament, as on his
watch we talked and smoked above the expanse
of rimpled water, and looked towards the sword-like
lightnings in the south.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span><a id='link_13'></a>XIII</h2>

<p>We came into grey waters, and also into a grey sort
of day, overcast and moody. In the evening the
wind was strong from the land, and laden with that
earthy scent which had so surprised me when I
first encountered it; a languid, rich and beguiling
perfume, that is tomb-like and unnerving in its
suggestion, rising over us. It made out for me the
spirit of Tom Hood&#8217;s last song, if it was his last
song; the one beginning &#8220;Farewell, life, my senses
swim&#8221;; its first verse ending &#8220;I smell the Mould
above the Rose,&#8221; and its second, &#8220;I smell the Rose
above the Mould.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hosea engaged me in discussion of Tennyson and
Edwin Arnold. He had been carrying out a lively
campaign in his room, where an unwelcome insect
had appeared lately; one would have doubted whether
any insect, however irrepressible, could have existed
in the atmosphere of cigar smoke which he daily
thickened in that room of his. But there it was, the
bug had been seen, and the whole room was overhauled.</p>

<p>This did not in any way deflect him from his
evening pursuit of the abstract. His resolution in
following a problem through its own difficult
aspects, combined with his control of the <i>Bonadventure</i>,
often made me wonder whether he was typical of his
fellow-captains. Though, as he said, the roaring-bull
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>
style of master mariner was almost extinct, I
could not help thinking him singular.</p>

<p>I woke at about four, following an inquiry into
some remote subject, from a dream of roaring thunderbolts,
out of whose red and whizzing track I was
crouching on the lee side of barns and cowsheds. I
looked out; there was a loud wind much like that
which brought the storm of the other Sunday. I
went back to bed a little disappointed. This squall
left the makings of a very good breeze blowing and
moreover lowered the temperature. The mate complained
of his khaki shorts; the second mate had had
to bring out another blanket, although it was a sunny
morning. The colour of the sea was changing as we
went at a striking rate; but prevailing, in those
shallower roads turbid with silt or sand was a greenness
as of horse-chestnut leaves at their prime. Here
and there were dark acres of discoloured water
drifting by, contrasting magnificently with the green
and its bright white-crested waves. The afternoon
brought into sight the dim shapes of coastline with
those now less familiar things trees and houses.
This advance was welcomed by Mead and the
apprentices who lived in his alleyway with spirited
but not spiritual songs.</p>

<p>The next day, Hosea was very early at the door of
the wireless operator&#8217;s cabin, endeavouring to get
a reply from the ship&#8217;s agents in Monte Video, to
questions sent some days before. I do not think he
succeeded. There was, however, much buzzing, and
I got up to enjoy the time of day. It was still keen
outside&#8211;&#8220;a nipping and an eager air&#8221;&#8211;the sky
being blue and the sun unclouded none the less;
over the drab green sea, a seagull or two in their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>
lordly fashions flapping against the wind; to starboard,
in a gentle haze, a view of rugged shore. This
point was one of mountainous eminences, rolling like
larger Downs, with white cliffs or sandy beaches
under their light red masses. Other steamers were
in our neighbourhood, on the same course out or
home, some bright with new paint, others scarred
and rusty. Probably they were having tripe in
batter for breakfast like ourselves, the prose part
of me suggested; and I felt with gratitude that I
must have become a new and better man, who
could now face and even look forward to a food
which had hitherto only interested me as a favourite
with C. Lamb.</p>

<p>The continued cold caused me to return to socks;
but I delayed the reinstatement of the collar, which
I had found no such necessity to human happiness.</p>

<p>It seemed no time at all before we had passed
Flores Island, and Monte Video came into view.
Bright sandy shores gave place to a parched sort of
greenery, as it looked, with large buildings here and
there; the town beyond lay terraced on rising ground,
its square monotonous buildings hot in the sun, whose
fervour the roofs returned in dazzling mirror-glare.
The spires and minarets of its more pretentious
architecture, something scantily, relieved the greyness
of the formal rows, barracks, warehouses and whatever
else. Farther on a rough squat cone of barren-looking
ground surmounted with another heavy
square-cut building caught but scarcely charmed the
eye. As the heat was dreary, so at a casual glance
through the smouldering air this town of flat roofs
and tiers.</p>

<p>Hosea, very smart, with his telescope under his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>
arm, and the second mate beside him, stood on the
bridge. Hosea was giving orders, the second mate
passing them on to the engineer below on the ringing
telegraph, and by megaphone to Meacock, who with
the carpenter stood to the anchor forward. Flags
were run up announcing the <i>Bonadventure</i>. No
answer, in the form of a launch, was vouchsafed so
early, although other ships moored round about us
were being visited by agents or doctors. The word
was given to let go the anchor. &#8220;Forty-five on the
windlass!&#8221; The cumbrous chain unwound and ran
down with a cloud of rust. The <i>Bonadventure</i> lay
still, even the cocoa-like mud which her propeller had
been diffusing in a few moments thinning away.</p>

<p>A gangway was let down over the side. Firemen
and engineers came up from the underworld and all&#8211;not
only the passenger&#8211;looked towards a motor
launch which now appeared making swiftly towards
us. She was tied up a moment later with ropes at
the foot of the gangway, and an Englishman emerging
from her small beautifully polished saloon, asked in
supercilious fashion for the captain. &#8220;Come
aboard.&#8221; &#8220;No, I can&#8217;t,&#8221; Hosea stalked forth with
successful dignity, as if unaware that anyone should
be calling; then, going back for the ship&#8217;s papers,
boarded the launch, and we heard that we were going
on to Buenos Aires. The papers were quickly seen
and restored; letters&#8211;general gloom!&#8211;were absent,
probably with some other agents; and the launch and
the young man in his beautiful suit, raiment for a
diplomat, departed.</p>

<p>We stayed here at anchor through the afternoon;
telescopes sprang up on all sides, even if to unacquainted,
non-cubist eyes the view was rather
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>
interesting than pleasing. Every half-hour or so, some
tramp would leave the harbour. Curiosity in their
case was small. Every half-hour, launches puffed
along to take back their pilots. The purlieus of
Monte Video with their apparent but distant gaiety,
even, were soon disregarded.</p>

<p>Bicker and Meacock exchanged humorous history
by the engine bunkers, in holiday mood. The
steward, who had lost little time in putting out a fishline,
leaned over the rail in meditation, not knowing
that his misanthropic look was being almost to a line
caught by Bicker behind him. Bicker also illustrated
in dumb show the action of heaving the poor old man
overboard. And, meanwhile, it was hot: no doubt
of that! Presently the doleful patience of the steward
was rewarded with a foolish-looking fish perhaps three
pounds in weight, which was soon cut into sectors
and salted.</p>

<p>When towards seven in the evening the anchor
was got up and the ship began to move up the River
Plate to Buenos Aires, the scene was one to be
remembered. Astern lay Monte Video with its lines
of lights, and from its hill one great light glowed out
momently; ahead lay the buoys of the channel,
flashing first red and then white in reassuring alternation
along our course; and the moon overhead,
pale with a stratum of thin cloud, or lost at times
behind echelons of stormier vapours, gave light
enough to hint at the look of the shores. At first
the captain, the mate and the anchor appeared the
three forces acting on the ship, the anchor especially,
which was loath to come aboard. At last it came,
and the <i>Bonadventure</i> went steadily up the river to
the pipe of a rising wind.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span>Hosea, well satisfied, sat down in his room with his
&#8220;purser&#8221; to theorize in our wonted way. The
beauty of the commonplace, it was; then we were
considering the simplicity of seafaring men. They
must be simple, he said, to have done what they had
done, including Columbus. Seafaring in sailing ships,
he described in the powerful phrase &#8220;fighting against
your God&#8221;; a phrase which I suppose the early
mariners in their piety might have applied to steamers.</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>Those trim skiffs unknown of yore&#8211;</p>
</div>

<p>I condense Coleridge&#8211;</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>That fear no spite of wind or tide!</p>
</div>

<p>Phillips joined us. &#8220;We&#8217;re discussing nautical history,
chief.&#8221; Being assured that this really was so,
Phillips said he was uncertain about the true story
of the <i>Golden Hind&#8217;s</i> boatswain, but he felt certain
about our not reaching Buenos Aires in the morning.
If he were not a moral man, he would &#8220;bet you, sir,
two pence on the point.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pilot, a tan-brown moustached little man,
came in&#8211;not for his black straw hat, but for his
oilskins and goloshes. &#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; said Phillips
with malevolent sympathy, &#8220;that&#8217;s right, pilot,
always keep your feet thoroughly dry.&#8221; The pilot
had at least the excuse that it was drizzling outside.</p>

<p>It blew hard and harder all night; and the next
morning, Sunday, one thought of the collapse of an
English October. About half-past seven we dropped
anchor in the &#8220;roads&#8221; outside our promised port;
on all sides bleakly lapping and passing the pea-soup
waters of the River Plate. Father Prout&#8217;s whimsical
haunting old lines pervaded my mind as I stared and
warmed myself with pacing up and down:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>With deep affection and recollection</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I often think of the Shandon bells,</p>
<p>Whose sounds so wild would, in days of childhood,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fling round my cradle their magic spells.</p>
<p>On this I ponder, where&#8217;er I wander,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus grow fonder, sweet Cork, of thee,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With thy bells of Shandon,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That sound so grand on</p>
<p>The pleasant waters of the River Lee.</p>
</div>

<p>Not far from his old loves, how did some of us once
for a brief stay, with those whirlpools in Flanders still
roaring more hungrily in our destiny, hear other bells
ring in enchanting coolness over the gliding boat,
borne on the bosom of wooded Blackwater!</p>

<p>But these bleak and turbid waters turned the
ringing song to parody, nor did the <i>Bonadventure&#8217;s</i>
bell, a war product, sound particularly grand upon
them as those past bells on their importal streams.
The outlook and the chilliness made breakfast unusually
welcome. The pilot came in, but having no
English to speak of (or with) he could not tell us his
real views on the weather and such important matters.
The chief loudly&#8211;for more clarity&#8211;pressed him with
such questions as &#8220;When does your next <span class='sc'>Strike</span>
begin?&#8221; but he smiled and ate on.</p>

<p>About dinner-time a fine white launch came out to
us; and a number of authorities, including some
doctors, came aboard. The ship&#8217;s company assembled
aft like an awkward squad, and the doctors came
along the line feeling pulses; a task which they did
genially and without strain. That done, and no
one being set aside for a further examination, all
dispersed. The authorities (a generous allowance of
them) proceeded to Hosea&#8217;s quarters, no doubt to
wind up the morning&#8217;s work in comfort. I listened
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>
meanwhile to Mead, who leaning over above their
launch, amused himself with making noisy and
scandalous observations upon its crew, their careers
and their faces. Why this fury? I really believe it
was his way of expressing fraternity.</p>

<p>So there was nothing to do but wait for our new
pilot on Monday morning: to play cards with a pack
whose age had given each card characteristic markings
besides those upon its face; to &#8220;yarn.&#8221; At tea,
Bicker was in his most assiduous narrative mood.
&#8220;We were in the West Indies in a boat bringing the
bumboat woman aboard&#8211;well, she started to climb
up the rope ladder and this fellow thought he&#8217;d lay
his hand on her ankle. So he made a move to do so.
Just then&#8221; (his broad grin grew almost incredibly
broad), &#8220;the boat gave a roll, and as he had one foot
on the gunwale, and one on the rope ladder he fell
into the water. Well, he went down past rows and
rows of plates, and we looked out for him to come
up.&#8211;First a hat, his black hat, came up. And then,
a newspaper came up&#8221;&#8211;[<i>Chief</i> (<i>ignored</i>) &#8220;To say he
wasn&#8217;t coming up?&#8221;]&#8211;and then, <i>he</i> came up. Stern
first. We dragged him on deck, and there he was all
spluttering, and then he said as solemn as a judge:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>&#8216;That&#8217;s the fruits of Blacklegging.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>This closed the proceedings.</p>

<p>Under the sunset the river&#8217;s dingy current began
to take on a strange glory, and changed into a tawny
golden wilderness moving down to sea. Then
presently it was full moon and pale splendours. A
great quiet prevailed; but led by the moon, like the
tide and the poets, Mead and myself paced the
decks for hours recalling the local colour of war apart
from fighting.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span><a id='link_14'></a>XIV</h2>

<p>A most placid morning. The sky ahead was silvered
with the smoke of unseen Buenos Aires, the water so
gleaming that the flat coast lined with trees, to starboard,
appeared to be midway suspended between
one mother-of-pearl heaven and another. The new
pilot arrived in this early tranquillity, and the ship
resumed her way up the channel marked out by buoys
of several shapes.</p>

<p>The sun increased in power all too fast. I stood
on the bridge to hear the pilot and the mates giving
their directions: we came to a couple of tugs told
off to escort the <i>Bonadventure</i> in. Ropes leapt aboard
us, tossed up in the adroitest way and caught as
cleverly by our sailors; the bigger cables were
attached to them, drawn aboard the tugs and made
fast; and so we went on with tugboats fore and aft.
The peculiar beauty of the morning mist over Buenos
Aires soon began to thin away and disclose great
buildings. And now we were almost at our journey&#8217;s
end; and in hurrying ease, drew past fishing boats
and small sailing craft into the harbour mouth. On
our port side, on a sort of palisade running out into
the estuary, a host of sea-eagles perched yelping,
their lean black bodies sharply designed in the white
light. Their motto I took to be: Multitude and solitude.
Beyond their grand stand appeared a green
grove of downward foliage, the gaudy precinct of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>
what, I was informed by the wireless operator, who
began to act the guide-book, was a destructor for the
frozen meat industry. He went on to specify the
number of animals daily converted and to give other
details which interested him, as an ex-wielder of the
pole-axe; but my attention was distracted by the
ships swinging into an approach crowded with
dredgers and their ugly barges swilling mud, with
motor-boats and lighters and as it looked to me every
sort of medium for water traffic, bright and drab,
proud and lowly in a confusion.</p>

<p>The waterway divides. To our left, a channel lies
under giant steel bridges. Our course is not there:
we are piloted towards a dock for passenger and cargo
ships, and entering it in a hot glare, and colouring that
almost sears, of sky and water and paint, we make our
berth, wallowing once over the water&#8217;s breadth to
the anger of lesser navigators, who go by in their
boats bawling at the bridge in general. The handsome
passenger boats with their great paddle-wheels
and their red awnings lie opposite our plebeian
resting-place: beside a grimy wharf, where small
cranes and coal carts seem to multiply.</p>

<p>Of an expectant company there on Wilson&#8217;s Wharf,
the chief feature was by immediate common consent
recognized in an old lady in a heliotrope dress, tightly
girdled&#8211;and she was of mountainous shape. The
demure inch of petticoat revealed below the hem of
her well-hitched skirt was not overlooked. Beside
this beldame, a long thin youth, a very reed straw by
comparison, puffed at a cherry cigarette-holder,
vacantly but fixedly eyed the ship and seemed to
await her instructions. A laundry cart, with an
insufficient animal in the shafts, stood behind them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>
and showed what they too stood for, emblems
peculiar.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the <i>Bonadventure</i> come to rest before
a swarm of anxious sallow ruffians were aboard for
the &#8220;ship&#8217;s orders.&#8221; The rooms of Hosea himself
were not free from their invasion; not free that is,
for a moment. Their intruding faces caused him to
roar in the most frightful fashion; at which, hesitating
as if before an injustice, they got out, but still hung
about the gangways. When, presently, he went
ashore to pay his official respects to the ship&#8217;s agents,
we saw a trail of these indefatigables close on his
heels, and on his return he said that four of them had
followed him all the way. I now perceived quite
plainly why, when I a stranger appeared aboard the
<i>Bonadventure</i> at Barry Dock and desired to find the
captain, there was no eager answer to my query.
Tailors, bootmakers (one with a motor-tyre or
a piece of one over his shoulder), engineers and
I don&#8217;t know who else formed the polysyllabic
cordon.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the <i>Bonadventure</i> was hauled in close
to the edge of the quay, and a gang of dock hands
came on deck bearing ropes and pulley blocks. The
ship&#8217;s derricks having been lifted, these made the
first preparations for discharging the cargo. The
hatches were laid open, and the planks covering them
pitched aside much as though they were so many
walking-sticks. I was not the only one deluded by
this despatch into thinking our discharge likely to
be over in a few days.</p>

<p>Buenos Aires; a tremendous town, a &#8220;southern
Paris,&#8221; a New-World epitome. So much, so little I
knew of it. It lay here, its heart not a half-hour&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>
walk from our mooring. But the vastness of the
rumoured hive, the heat, I daresay indolence too,
prevented me from taking this first opportunity
for walking into the strange streets. It was excessively
hot, and that settled the matter. There was
plenty to watch on the river and alongside: it would
have been odd, if it had not proved so. So, swollen
somewhat with the feeling that I was now a considerable
seafarer, and not unpleased to be mistaken
for one by the miscellaneous visitors who had by
this examined the decks and accommodation&#8211;all
doors locked&#8211;somewhat fruitlessly, but still loitered,
I stayed idle.</p>

<p>Trenches will recur to their old inhabitants. The
small coal in the yards here stood walled in with
a breastwork of sandbags, built with tolerable skill
upon the old familiar pattern of headers and stretchers
and as I happened to be remarking upon this fact
to the wireless man, interrupting his propaganda
about a strike in which he personally would resist
to the last, a little launch chanced past with the
name <i>Ypres</i> on her bows.</p>

<p>She was but one of an endless to and fro of small
craft. The tall and airy passenger boats, at intervals,
came by in brilliance. When there was a pause in
this coming and going, and nothing more happening
on the water than the snapping of the small yellow
catfish at bread floating below the ship, I still felt
a quiet and languid gratitude for the novelty of being
where I was.</p>

<p>That gratitude was to be tempered soon. The
plague of the mosquitoes of the docks had been
painted dark enough for me during the days of
approach; and when I got to bed, the threatened
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span>
invasion had begun. Determining not to consider
the question at all, I read deep in my pocket copy of
Young&#8217;s <i>Night Thoughts on Life, Death and Immortality</i>,
as in worse quarters many a time, and duly
went to sleep like a philosopher.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span><a id='link_15'></a>XV</h2>

<p>Could this be Saint Valentine&#8217;s Day? Here in a
dreary looking dock with a surplus of sun but a
seeming lack of oxygen, and only a sort of amphibious
race as company? Newspapers were at any rate
valentine enough. They were read with real care,
football results being perhaps the consolation most
sought.</p>

<p>Hosea showed me the way into the town. We
turned out over the docks, out at last from a kingdom
of coal-dust, over a swing bridge; took a tram, and
were soon at the shipping agents&#8217; offices. He spent
some time in earnest conference here, and the visit
ended with a visit to other agents&#8217; offices, and that
again with an adjournment with a serene member of
the staff to a bar. In this excellent place, my ignorance
of a kind of drink, saffron in colour and with a
piece of pineapple submerged, was soon dispelled.
The collection of olives, biscuits, monkey-nuts and
flakes of fried potato which the waiter brought with
the drinks was to me unexpected. We went, with
our good-natured guide, to lunch in a huge hotel.
Gaining the top of the building by the lift, we sat
at a table near the windows of a luxurious room filled
with luxurious people, and had the pleasure of looking
as we ate over the less celestial roofs of the town
to the calm flood of the River Plate beyond. Distance
lent enchantment to this view also. The conditions
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>
were good for eating, our friend&#8217;s romantic tales
apart.</p>

<p>We departed from this commendable place, and,
there being still engagements for Hosea with the
shipping agents, we went there. Emerging, he had
to go to the British Consulate. We hired a taxi.
The traffic of Buenos Aires, or practice and precept
differ, was free from irksome restrictions of speed;
and we were whirled over the cobblestones and tramlines
and round trams, horsemen, wagons, rival cars
and everything else in a breath-taking rush. &#8220;I
get in these things,&#8221; said Hosea, &#8220;saying to myself,
If I don&#8217;t come out of this alive, then I shan&#8217;t.&#8221;
We got out alive. The Consul&#8217;s workshop (it was
perhaps known by a more dignified name) was in a
scrubby street; and the young man in charge had
my sympathy. However, it was not my fault that
he was being slowly roasted.</p>

<p>That call left Hosea at liberty to explore the town.
We walked on and on, looking at the shops, and be it
acknowledged at the beauties who went by, until
we arrived at the small park over which the Museum
rises to that southern sun, ornate and massy. Here
we entered to spend the afternoon among a few visitors
and as many official incumbents. We entered
solemnly resolved to find a Palace of Art&#8211;Hosea
putting away from him all his connection with ships
and the worries of that next necessity, the &#8220;charter
party.&#8221;</p>

<p>Plaster casts and original statuary were plentiful
in the Museum. The eye of the weary mariners
rested none too long upon these. The multitude
of paintings, however, were considered gently and
methodically: Hosea would stand before the weakest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>
trying to comprehend the artist&#8217;s intention, and to
claim something in his daub as a virtue. Sometimes
he would put on his eyeglass to survey the subject.
To me, there seemed no such quality here&#8211;I speak as
a scribe, without authority&#8211;as there was quantity.</p>

<p>There have been many energetic and accomplished
administerings of paint, but to what purpose? The
eternal allegory, demanding one nude figure or more,
and justifying by the general level Hosea&#8217;s praise
of a well-known picture called &#8220;September Morning,&#8221;
or sweetened description of evening, with its cows
coming home under its warped moon, its ploughman
in a vague acre, and the rest. Was this the southern
genius?</p>

<p>One or two modern pictures here revealed a strength
and idiosyncrasy beyond almost all the rest. A
portrait of six youths, drawn with fierce intensity of
colour and of line, expressing distinctions of character
in subtle vital sharpness, long detained me.
Another untypical picture, as recent as the last, was
based upon a rustic festival or ritual with which I
of course was unacquainted; but the epic lives of
peasant men and women in their long combat with
the stern giver of grain were legible in the strange
georgic faces and the mysterious melancholy glory
of their assembly.</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8211;Seemed listening to the earth,</p>
<p>Their ancient mother, for some comfort yet.</p>
</div>

<p>Among the many harmless little pieces representing
vases of flowers, woodland melody, and other conventions,
I caught sight of a portrait of a young girl
(&#8220;My lady at her casement&#8221; type) drawn with mild
ability. The signature, very large and clear, was</p>

<div class='center'>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span><span class='sc'>Ch. Chaplin.</span></p>
</div> <!-- centered -->

<p>On referring to the minute brass plate beneath so
innocent a vanity, we learned that Charles Chaplin,
1825-1891, was a painter of the &#8220;French School.&#8221;
Pictures must run in the family.</p>

<p>The first afternoon, Hosea and myself could find
no specimen of an English artist among the multitude:
but returning another day to make certain
(and once again we had the gallery more or less to
ourselves) we found a small and typical study by
Wilkie, and a portrait by Sir Thomas Lawrence.
Before this last, a work of the loftiest morality&#8211;in
its subject I mean&#8211;and of a colouring delicately
fine, Hosea stood in enthusiasm. &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure,&#8221; he
said, and once again drew an impression before proceeding,
&#8220;that that isn&#8217;t the finest thing we&#8217;ve seen.&#8221;
The spectacle of King Arthur in his bronze near the
exit, in his bronze but somehow devoid of his grandeur,
ended our artistic adventures. The business of
criticism, no doubt, is to keep cool: but this we had
scarcely been able to do. I should have given up
early, but for the determination of Hosea; and even
he began to feel the scorching heat above the æsthetic
calm.</p>

<p>The ship&#8217;s football was brought out in the evening,
and on a patch of waste ground alongside, flanked by
thickets of rank weed, and ankle-deep in sand and
coal-dust, we enjoyed ourselves most strenuously.
There were one or two real drawbacks. A vigorous
and unwary kick was apt to send the ball into the
river, and to recover it meant clambering up and down
the slanting wall of the wharf, which was coated with
black grease, fishing with a pole, anxiously watching
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span>
the currents, and quickly becoming as black and
greasy as the masonry. And on the other hand,
there was here a depôt of large drain-pipes, which
might equally receive the erratic ball; then arose
the questions: Whereabouts in the pipes had it
bounced? Would the drain-pipe on which you were
standing really roll from under you and bring down
a dozen others? Meanwhile the watchman of the
depôt would be there uttering untranslated dissatisfaction
with the whole affair.</p>

<p>We had not been in the South Basin many minutes
when the chaplain of The Missions to Seamen was
among us with his witty stories and, I believe, his
put-and-take teetotum. At any rate, the latter
became as well recognized a part of his equipment as
his quips. At his invitation, I went several times
to the Mission, which was quite the rendezvous for
the crews of British ships in the port. Its concert
room, its billiard room and other comfortable places
were generally very lively, the two chaplains apparently
possessing an inexhaustible reserve of cheerfulness.
English ladies too came there to brighten the
evenings, to sing and join in at cards and conversation;
their generosity, I believe, furnished the other
refreshments of these evenings.</p>

<p>Next door to the Mission, a dingy annexe to a sort
of grocery, labelled the &#8220;British Bar,&#8221; was not
neglected. Talk and beer and smoke prevailed here
until midnight and afterwards: indeed, I had scarcely
sat down before a vast mate from some other ship
had challenged me to name a better Test Match
captain than Mr. Fender. Other patrons of the
Oval soon took up the cry, but I resisted for the rest
of the session.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>The discharge of coal began, a monotonous process
however considered; down in the hold one saw
through the busy dust a small but growing mine-crater
done in coal, at the foot of which were lying,
stooping, chattering, the nearly naked figures of the
labourers. Negroes they looked down there, but
were white unofficially. They shovelled now from
this side, now from that into a great iron bucket:
above, at a sign, the man with his lever set the winch
working and the derrick hoisted the bucket up and
over, then down into the lighter that lay alongside.
And so with intervals through the day. Then at
night, the dock&#8217;s aboriginal mosquitoes came forth;
as the mate said, like a German band, all the most
agonizing shades of musical audacity emanating
from them. They drove not only me but old hands
out on deck at night, where a chilly autumn wind
was blowing, which drove us indoors again. But as
the light grew, our tormentors lessened. The sun
ariseth, and they get them away together, and lay
them down in their dens.</p>

<p>To avoid these visitors as much as possible, I
refrained from exploring the town over tiringly during
the day, and went off with Mead in his shore suit
after the evening&#8217;s football on the dust-patch: and
stayed as late as meanderings in the town could make
it. We certainly departed from the usual haunts of
sailors the first night; went on and on, until even the
adventurous Mead had to say: &#8220;This is rather a
depraved kind of street.&#8221; And more, there was something
in the air&#8211;some way off, we heard the interrupted
fire of (what roused imagination converted
into) a machine gun. The slatternly folk sitting,
with white gleams of face or dress in the shadows,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>
by their doors; the herds of unaccustomed faces in
the large threadbare bars; the many groups of folk
standing expectantly about the street, and our own
alien solitude&#8211;all gave this sensation of disquiet.
In a manner enjoying it, we proceeded, past an
orator roaring out in fine fury to a small but intent
crowd, and presently found ourselves in a large square
with its many lamps, its glossy cars stealing swiftly
by or waiting on the rank, its fountains playing like
mists among deep green of trees.</p>

<p>Magnificent, and nearly empty, was the café into
which we went; brilliant its interior; attached to the
gilded columns, how eloquent of drinking as a fine
art, its scoreboards announcing the many specialities!
We stayed until midnight. Then, having roughly
found out our way home, we set out for the docks,
and, pausing to divine the sense of a poster giving
details of a &#8220;Radical&#8221; demonstration for the next
day, saw the police come hurrying up to a gathering
of people round the next bar door. One of the police
as he passed us at speed caught his toe against a stone
and with his sword and fine feathers came down flat
on the pavement. The gathering at the bar door
were so absorbed in their topic that no one looked,
much less laughed at his loud discomfiture.</p>

<p>Sometimes I found an occasion to leave the <i>Bonadventure</i>
in her noisy dishabille, during the day.
There was one walk with the wireless operator to a
smaller tramp in a distant dock, aboard which somewhat
shapelier ship than the <i>Bonadventure</i> he had
an acquaintance. Walking over the irregular cobbles
and among the railway lines of the wharves in the heat
was a sufficient exercise. We left our ship carpeted
with coal-dust; passed cattle pounds, grain elevators
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>
glaring white, and on the opposite side steamers in
process of being loaded or discharged; went along a
rail track where the grains which had lain longest
had sprung up in unavailing green, and under chutes
where sacks of corn were sliding down to the holds of
ships. The mate of the <i>Primrose</i> whom we had come
to see was thoroughly happy, and resembled almost
to a hair my sergeant observer of years before. Putting
on a record&#8211;his gramophone was actually in
order&#8211;and offering cigars, he produced an extraordinary
picture of his ship, in needlework. The
ancient art of the sampler had passed to him. He
seemed, I noticed, <i>of</i> his ship: its mahogany-lined
saloon and more domestic style were congenial with
his paterfamilias air and &#8220;Not to-day, thank you&#8221;
mildness to various business callers. The wireless
operator, also, seemed to be less interested in the
regulations of his calling and more in photographs
of ships and sailors. With these kind spirits in my
mind, I was somewhat preoccupied as we walked
back the way we came among the pigeons and the
dock labourers stretched out under every railway
truck and crane for their siesta.</p>

<p>Then there were one or two more rounds of the
town with Hosea, chiefly in the busiest neighbourhood.
I began to know the tall statue of Columbus as a
landmark. All the morning, perhaps, Hosea would
be going from one office to another, seeking to define
the ship&#8217;s future and to hasten her discharge, while
I kicked my heels in entrances under the suspicious
eyes of the janitors. Kindness was readier in the
frowsy offices of the ship&#8217;s chandlers; whence the
delectably dressed youth the firm&#8217;s son soon led the
way to a table and vermouth in the Avenida de Mayo.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>
We went again, with a new companion, to the Florida
restaurant for our lunch: but the new companion
and myself having been contemporary in the Ypres
salient, our excessive reminiscences began to pall
upon the long-suffering Hosea. One day Hosea
entrusted to me, for transport to the ship, the sailors&#8217;
wages in notes, and the letters. He was staying
ashore, and did not fancy the prospect of carrying so
much money about with him. Neither did I; but
it is hard to say whether the responsibility for the
pay overshadowed that for the letters. I was pleased
to climb aboard the <i>Bonadventure</i> with both, after
passing through the knock-off rush from the docks.
But I seemed to be blamed for not bringing letters
for every one; such is the lot of the volunteer.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span><a id='link_16'></a>XVI</h2>

<p>There was a feeling (based on observation) aboard
the <i>Bonadventure</i> that the discharge of the ship was
not being carried out with all possible speed, owing
to the prevailing mysterious influences of the offices
in the town. Delays were many. This augury of a
long sojourn in our present berth depressed many of
us: I had already observed, or judged, that whatever
the earlier mariners may have thought of seafaring,
the modern sailor&#8217;s idea in sailing is to get back home
as early as possible. We soon heard that four days
of public holiday, the Carnival, would be added to
our term. It was evident that one must make the
best of it, and be thankful on those days when some
actual progress was made.</p>

<p>Mosquitoes, as I have said, were a great subject
here. We had opportunities to study them. With
<i>Macbeth</i> in hand as a convenient weapon., I
nightly reduced the horde, but these</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>Stubborn spearsmen still made good</p>
<p>The dark impenetrable wood.</p>
</div>

<p>The heat grew sickly sometimes at night, and the
cabins were black with flies and mosquitoes alike.
To sleep there was to be slowly suffocated, let alone
the folly of sleeping among man-eaters. An outdoor
faith was forced upon me, and yet the deck was no
real enclosure from the enemy: the faith would end
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>
at four or so in the morning, a time of day to which I
was becoming as accustomed as of old, and when the
riverside gave off a smell which I remembered noticing
in the trench regions east of Béthune. Then, still
hopeful, I would face my cabin and soon after swathing
myself in the brief sheets of the bunk would be
asleep. That interim unrecognized, here I was awake
again in a world where chisels chip paint and steam-driven
machines tip tons of coal. The great buckets
were now being strung over to railway vans, which
were shunted duly by a small engine. Winches
clattered and wrenched, the clanking engine bustled
almost ludicrously up and down the wharf, and all
seemed in a great hurry, but the hurry was only on
the surface. The yellow river, the coal-dust, the
glaring sun, the dockside streets and warehouses and
of course the eternal mosquito began to play upon me.
My body was in pain from the innumerable bites and
want of rest, and generally I was in as low spirits as I
could be.</p>

<p>The ship was daily haunted by newsboys, fruit-sellers,
and others. The news was difficult to discover
from the queer columns of short cabled messages, and
yet we never sent the newsboy away unless, perhaps,
our only means was in English coppers. Sixpences
he (not unwisely) was willing to take. The fruit-sellers
gave better value for sixpence, even though
their open panniers seemed always liable to the
predatory paws of the water police. The shoemaker
with his motor tyre put pieces of it upon my shoes,
grunting out a satisfaction with the job which I
hardly shared. A thin gentleman with furs, puzzle
boxes, and other cheap-jack gear was not much called
upon though called at.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span>Two Englishmen came also, sellers of furs; one,
of my own Division in France. They were very
warm in their praise of Buenos Aires, and besides
bringing good furs with them they brought good
spirits.</p>

<p>Football flourished. In red-hot sunlight, we met
the team of another ship. Grim determination was
in the game and its afterthoughts; and by a happy
accident my foot scored the first goal of our victory.
It was counted unto me for righteousness. The form
of address &#8220;Passenger&#8221; acquired a respectful significance.
There was immediately arranged a return
match. But</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>Antres et vous fontaines!</p>
</div>

<p>The hart desireth the waterbrooks; and so did we.
Again, on such a summer afternoon, we went at it,
upon the field we had hired for the ordeal. This time
we lost, but still the blood of the team was up; the
<i>Bonadventure&#8217;s</i> fair name was in jeopardy. Again
there was immediately arranged a return match for
the following evening. We lost, and it was hotter
still. This nevertheless cooled the ardour of the
footballers, and did not finally ruin the reputation of S.S. <i>Bonadventure</i>.</p>

<p>The evening form of this game continued upon the
original ground, but my connection, like Mead&#8217;s, soon
declined. The main cause was that the ball, or
Ball&#8211;its importance aboard requires the capital letter&#8211;flew
off one evening as usual into the dock, but
there by some conspiracy of wind and current sailed
along at a merry rate until it was carried under the
framework of piers upon which the coal wharf was
built&#8211;a noisome place, a labyrinth of woodwork. If
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>
it stayed here, it was generally out of sight and beyond
reach; if it was swirled out, it would go on out,
into the middle stream, and doubtless into the Atlantic.
We groped along the filthy piles of the tunnel,
and the darkness was imminent; when the ball
suddenly appeared, decidedly going out into the
middle stream. At this crisis, Mead with a war-cry
plumped into the evil-looking water and brought off a
notable rescue.</p>

<p>Cricket would have seemed the more seasonable
sport. Twice Mead and myself joined the Mission
XI for grand matches in the suburbs, and said to
ourselves, &#8220;In the midst of football we are in cricket&#8221;;
but twice we met with disappointment, the rain
choosing the wrong days altogether.</p>

<p>I had naturally observed silence over my journalistic
life of the remote past, but one evening at the British
Bar I was asked, was it not true that I was a relation
of Kipling? and at the Mission &#8220;your book&#8221; was
several times alluded to. It was, I think, taken for
granted that being a penman I should be <i>writing up</i>
my adventures, as though I were on a voyage to
Betelgueux or Sirius. I was asked to recite some of
my poems, also, by a lady, but I was churl enough to
ask her pardon on that score. She evidently felt
this the basest ingratitude. &#8220;Why? Why not give
us a recitation? I&#8217;m sure you can.&#8221; I tried to
explain that my attempts were frequently, almost
invariably, of a meditative cast of mind, not suitable
for the platform. At this she sniffed and I felt that
my explanation was disgraceful in the highest degree.</p>

<p>Entertainment was not lacking there at the Mission.
It was a hearty place. One evening Tich, the pride
of the <i>Bonadventure</i>, who in his uniform cut a most
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>
splendid figure, went into the ring and laid about him
magnificently. Or there might be a concert, local
talent obliging. A passenger ship&#8217;s varieties drew a
large attendance both from the ships and the shore;
there was much funny man, much jazz band, much
conjuring, much sentimental singing&#8211;in fact plenty
of everything which is expected at popular concerts,
and every one departed with reflected pride. Mead
and myself, however, quarrelled over the amount
which I subscribed to the whip-round. It was that
or nothing&#8211;I had but one coin; and its removal
robbed us of our wonted refreshment. We walked
somewhat moodily down the road to the docks,
unsoothed by their thick coarse greenery, which the
night filled with the incessant buzzing of crickets
and a loud piping whistle perhaps from a sort of
cricket also, while here and there a fire-fly went
along with his glow-worm light.</p>

<p>We tried the cinematograph&#8217;s recreations, once or
twice. How strong is habit! We could not settle
down to these performances of single films; nor to
the box-like halls. A cowboy film of eight acts
comes back to my recollection from those evenings.
It was full of miracles. The operator believed, like
the hero, in lightning speed. The hero on horseback
was far too speedy for the villain who dragged off
the heroine into his car and did his best to break
records. These heroes will one day assume the
proportions, in the dark world, of the pleiosaurus in
natural history.</p>

<p>But we had our reward. In a more expensive
theatre, we found <i>The Kid</i>. We had come out
to see a much trumpeted film of a bullfight&#8211;Mead
for one set of reasons, I for another; but it was of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>
yesterday, and we had no difficulty in consoling
ourselves. One Chaplin, we acknowledged, was
better than many toreadors.</p>

<p>And then, we had a glimpse of the Carnival. In
our wonted quarter of the town, that where the
seafaring man mostly rested, it took the form of some
processions of hobbledehoys and urchins, beating as
their kind do on drums and things like drums. The
next evening we took the same dreary cobblestone
walk as usual, but did not limit ourselves to that.
We took a tram, indeed, to more fashionable haunts
and at last came into the great Avenida and all its
garish illuminations; its paper ribbons were as
multi-coloured as the lights, and, flung from the
upper storeys of the hotels, in some places they were
thick enough to form a fantastic and absurd cascade.
Here the Carnival was in mid sprout. We got what
we came for&#8211;a diversion.</p>

<p>The pavements, broader here than in the generality
of the streets we knew, were chock-a-block with folks,
the cafés overflowing, the towering hotels gleaming
with bright dresses on every balcony, and all this
was the accompaniment of the gorgeous procession
that moved slowly along the highway. Its vehicles
of every kind, but their kind hidden from passing
observation by their curtains and festoons of flowers,
trooped along in the unreal glare. Here, ladies of
most aristocratic air came by, with the blackest of
masks above the whitest of countenances; there was
a girl in the dress of a bull-fighter, driving her own
light carriage; next, a set of laughing &#8220;gipsies&#8221;
apparently advertising a brand of cigarettes; then,
a collection of men with Cyrano disguises and attempting
Cyrano humour to the gods&#8211;</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>All these and more came flocking.</p>
</div>

<p>But the privilege of gazing unrebuked upon the
profusion of beauty, upon raven hair and great deep-burning
eyes, upon the pale cheeks of wintry moons,
the privilege of hearing the disjointed music of the
fu-fu bands and the verbal crackers of harlequins of
the moment, was not without its points of misery.
The pavements represented a scrum on the largest
scale, in the forefront of one battering ram whereof
Mead and myself were securely wedged in for an
hour or two. In this state of things, the usual
individual turned round to ask Mead &#8220;who he was
pushing?&#8221;&#8211;the sense of his remarks being obvious
though couched in another tongue. Unable to move
the arms, and scarcely free to flicker the eyelashes,
we were borne compressedly and gradually on, until at
last we were beyond the main pleasure-ground; by
this time even Mead had had enough of pleasures
which we had noticed others than Englishmen taking
seriously. We took our ease in our inn, and reflected.</p>

<p>The newspapers reported that the Carnival was
declining year by year. Perhaps the reporter, like
ourselves, had corns and was caught in the scrimmage.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span><a id='link_17'></a>XVII</h2>

<p>I borrowed a Shakespeare from the second chaplain
at the Mission to escape from what seemed the dullness
of our stay in South Basin, Buenos Aires. Mead
had taken over my own copy of the Tragedies, and by
this time had most of <i>Hamlet</i> and <i>Macbeth</i> by heart,
so that our conversation frequently ran by tags.
Of Bicker we saw little. Highly favoured, he would
depart on most afternoons to the English suburb,
where he had friends; and it was impossible not to
regard him, as he regarded himself, as a man of
superior rank, who had personal friends in this town.
Once or twice in the evenings, nevertheless, he came
with us to our accustomed table in that convenient
but inglorious place the British Bar; and while
there, he did his best to annoy one of the waiters with
the oft-repeated slur, &#8220;Yah, Patagonio,&#8221; or &#8220;You
b&#8213; Patagonian Indian,&#8221; or &#8220;Patagonio no bonio.&#8221;
The fellow bore it at first with grinning patience;
but one evening suddenly danced with fury, and
rushing out summoned the greasy little proprietor,
who came in scowling and snarling, took stock of us&#8211;and
went out again. The alleged Patagonian was
after this understood to be meditating a fearful
revenge.</p>

<p>At evening sometimes the autumn sun, going down,
a golden ball, behind the great buildings, and dimmed
with a calm transition in the distance of that time
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>
of day, removed my mind entirely from these and
similar matters. An incomplete state of recollection,
the more delightful to me from the strangeness of
my temporary lodging, a presence felt but understood,
a trouble in the pool whose surface bore the evidence
of neither windwave&#8217;s running V nor bubble subtly
appearing, took hold of me. Unable to remain aware
of this confused echo long, without endeavouring to
resolve it into communicable notes, I would soon find
myself counting up memories as plainly as the fellow
on the other side of the water was tallying the brown
hides discharged into river barges by the paddle-wheeler.
It was this verging upon a vision, unknown
but longed for, and this inevitable falling back to
known fact, which perhaps depressed me and made
the time pass all too slowly here.</p>

<p>The rattle of the cranes, so often interrupted, was
all the more welcome; the news of progress began to
assume a better look; the incidents of life in dock,
from the angry officiousness of the wharf manager,
a crude foreigner, to the arrival of passenger boats
and the swarm of gay-coloured families to and from
them, became worth attention again. Food, so
interesting at sea, lately become a burden, was reinstated;
boiled eggs for instance were welcomed, after
a régime of steaks, by the whole saloon. The whole
saloon&#8211;no; Bicker, the man about town, refused his
with a criticism, likening them to plasticine. With
his put-and-take top, the youthful-spirited chaplain
came more often, and often expressed his regret that
we were soon to be away.</p>

<p>Orders were not yet forthcoming. It was feared,
and often urged upon me with reference to my late
troubles, that the <i>Bonadventure</i> would be sent up the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>
river to Rosario. I made a great mistake about
Rosario and other possible destinations up the river,
their names suggesting ancient Spanish romantic
traditions to me: I mentioned my feelings to the
assembled saloon. All the romance there, it seemed,
was hidden behind a cloud of patriarchal mosquitoes.</p>

<p>The discharge of coal was at last over and done.
The day following, Hosea sent for me and told me
that the ship would shift at two, and perhaps&#8211;for
all he knew&#8211;straight out to sea. I told him I should
not be clinging to the stones of Buenos Aires at that
hour.</p>

<p>But it was not our fate to depart altogether that
day. Instead of going out into the open water, when
at three the pilot and the tugs brought the <i>Bonadventure</i>
out from her Stygian berth at Wilson&#8217;s
Wharf and down to the outer port, we now turned
into an arm of the docks called Riachuelo. There,
between a steel sailing-ship which gave no sign of
life and a great black mechanical ferry or transporter,
and further&#8211;there was no doubt about this&#8211;beside a
guano works, we were tied up for a time as yet undefined.</p>

<p>The change was, partly on account of the neighbouring
industry, &#8220;uncertain if for bale or balm.&#8221; I
felt that we might even miss the lively sight of the
passenger boats coming and going, and all their
gilded press of friends and acquaintances about the
landing-places; their tiers of bright lamps at night
rounding the bend between us and the Roads. Perhaps
the youths would no longer come by with their
ship&#8217;s stores of macaroni, their jars of wine and
panniers of onions and other vegetables; nor the
lighters, with their crews glaring in unwashed and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>
unchallenged independence in the whole world&#8217;s face,
and their yellow mongrels scampering up and down
the decks. The British Bar with the Patagonian
Indian and the giant but amicable cockroaches would
be too far away. However, we had the prospect of
other monotonous distractions if not those. For
there were evidence of benefit; green swampy groves,
a sort of common with ragged horses at feed, and
farther off the irregular line of a landscape not unlike
summer&#8217;s horizon, gave the eye a pleasant change.
Football would now be possible on grass and not a
dust-heap. Sailor-town was on the opposite bank&#8211;a
miscellany of ship&#8217;s chandlers&#8217; offices, gin palaces,
untidy trams, and nondescript premises.</p>

<p>The gangway was lowered, the donkeyman was
seen at once going ashore with his mandoline, and
we ourselves of the football persuasion followed with
the Football. We returned in time to see the
steward&#8217;s patience nominally rewarded with a small
yellow catfish, who showed the greatest wrath at the
trick which had been played on him, stiffening his
poisonous fin and actually barking.</p>

<p>The next morning, despite the odour of the guano,
was a better one than those in South Basin. For all
its mud, the river looked cheerful; its many small
craft, as yellow as vermilion or as green as paint
could make them, lying quiet or passing by, caught
the early sun. Even the dredgers&#8217; barges, with their
hue of Thiepval in November, showed the agreeable
activities of a new day, and breakfast.</p>

<p>But we were not to be long in Riachuelo. About
midday it became known that the <i>Bonadventure</i> was
to leave before evening for Bahia Blanca, a three
days&#8217; journey to the south. The further orders,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>
what cargo was to be received, and where it was to
be delivered, were as yet withheld. Phillips, the
chief engineer, was disappointed at this departure&#8211;his
son would have been able to meet him in town
within a day or two. To leave a message for him
in charge of the Mission, he proposed that I should
go with him in the afternoon, and that I was happy
to do.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, awaiting dinner, we strolled along the
waterside. It was sultry and glaring. We passed
shipping of all sorts and conditions, old junk, discarded
masts, boilers eaten through with rust, anchors
imbedded in the ground, even a torpedo-boat gone
to ruin, nameless; saw an incredibly old man with
his beard done in a knot, whittling away at a piece
of wood in the sun, tribes of mongrel dogs, and the
casual population of the tin town which rambled
here drowsy and malodorous, down to the water&#8217;s
edge. The purple trumpet-like flowers that climbed
the ragged woodwork seemed not more gay, nevertheless,
than the young men and women who crowded
to and from the transporter between this shipping
parish and Buenos Aires.</p>

<p>From Buenos Aires itself, what but the hastiest
impression could I take away with me? Melancholy
it was to me to find so little apparent survival of the
town as it must have been in its first centuries. My
last walk did not altogether revise my picture of bar-tobacconist-bar-tobacconist;
of powdered Venuses,
over-dressed Adonises; of shops without display,
receding obscurely; of cinematograph theatres
crudely decorated with notices of rank buckjumping
&#8220;dramas&#8221;; of innumerable tramways, here, there
and everywhere; of green sunny courtyards at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>
end of passages between dismal shuttered façades;
of trees with drooping foliage before flat roofs with
flimsy chimneys&#8211;mere drain-pipes&#8211;at the top of
high white dead walls; of bonneted policemen
with their hands on their swords; of boys teasing
horses; of whizzing taxis, and dray-horses fighting
for a start on the inimical cobbles; of pavements
suitable for tight-rope walkers; of the power of
money; of living for the present, or the day after
to-morrow; of a straw-hat existence. But I must
admit that my scantiest notions of a town refer in
temper to the quality of its second-hand bookshops.</p>

<p>So then, the ship being under orders to leave at
four, soon after five the port authorities held a sort
of roll-call amidships, and the pilots and the tugs
arrived. The port authorities consisted of a young
officer who looked likely to trip himself up with his
beautiful sword, a lanky humorist, with sergeant&#8217;s
chevrons, at his heels, and one or two other attendants.
Soon after these vigilants had gone down the ladder
again, the <i>Bonadventure</i> began to move, and the bags
of guano were a tyranny that is overpast. That
channel into which I had been pleased to see the
<i>Bonadventure</i> come I now watched her leave without
remorse. The dredgers fall behind our course, the
fishing-boats, and the perches of the sea-eagles. We
met a breeze, surprisingly strong, which made even
these slothful waters choppy. The sun went out in
a colder sky, beyond the outlines of the great chimneys
and transporters; and presently a line of
dwindling lights, surmounted by one or two more
conspicuous, stood for Buenos Aires. Meantime the
wind blew hard and loud. When the first pilot went
to make his way home, the tug coming up for him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>
was flung against the sides of the ship two or three
times, and he was obliged to jump from his swaying
rope ladder, &#8220;judging the time.&#8221; We ran on, with
many red and yellow lights flashing around our track.
The taste of coal-dust, let alone the feel of it as a
garment, made me wish the wind an early good night.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span><a id='link_18'></a>XVIII</h2>

<p>There were differences of opinion about the precise
distance between Buenos Aires and Bahia Blanca, in
which it seemed the authority of the steward was not
accepted. Travelling light, however, the <i>Bonadventure</i>
seemed little concerned about fifty miles
either way. A current assisted in this turn of speed.</p>

<p>It was enjoyable to be out of sight of land once
more, in a morning coolness, with seagulls piping in
our wake; although they were yellowish waters that
were rolling by. The second pilot went down to the
motor boat due to take him home; the blue peter
was hauled down when he had gone; and we hurried
south. A dove came by, alighted; presumably our
course lay at no great distance from the coast: a sail,
a smoke-trail here and there dappled the circling scene.
The sailors and apprentices set to, cleaning the holds
in preparation for a cargo of grain&#8211;a black job.
Bucketful after bucketful was flung over the side,
the wind playfully carrying off the murky clouds. I
washed clothes at a safe distance.</p>

<p>It was at this time or near it that an addition to
my daily course was made. So long as the <i>Bonadventure</i>
was at sea, the ship&#8217;s officers received cocoa
and sandwiches by way of supper. To this edible
privilege I could not imagine that I had the slightest
claim, nor in fact was I anxious to be elected; but
when the steward out of his magnanimity conferred
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>
it upon me I naturally received it with thanks.</p>

<p>The cocoa indeed was not to be lightly considered
when ten o&#8217;clock found me, as it mostly did, with
Mead on his night watch. The first night after we
had left the mouth of the Plate, his mind was full of
one matter. Before we had been released from
Wilson&#8217;s Wharf, acting on the advice of the vendor,
he had bought a fifth share in a lottery ticket. With
this qualification, he began to paint his future in all
the colours of £1,166&#8211;his possible, or as he wished
to be assured, his probable, harvest. A small schooner,
in the enchanted atmosphere of his pipe, seemed
already to own him master; she would trade for
long years of prosperity in South Sea islands, where
uncultivated fruits and beauties abound. While we
agreed on the plan, the moon went down; multitudes
of stars shone out, and meteors at moments ran down
the sky. A broad glow to starboard revealed the
nearness of the coast. Everything was most still,
except perhaps Mead&#8217;s spirit. There might be some
hitch. But no, he felt his luck was in; he was sure,
something told him that he carried the winning
number.</p>

<p>The day&#8217;s entries in my diary now began thus, or
nearly: &#8220;Need I say it again&#8211;One mosquito, etc.,
but I killed him; then, one mosquito, etc.&#8221; The
persistence of these self-satisfied hovering devils was
puzzling, for the mornings dawned almost bitterly
fresh, and the breeze was always awake. Its direction
had now laid, during the night, a carpet of glittering
coal-dust along the passage outside the door; and the
day being Sunday, which should by all precedent be
marked by an increased radiance in the outward as
well as in the inward man, it was impossible to keep
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>
clean. For the inward man, I once again took refuge
in Young&#8217;s <i>Night Thoughts</i>, which, despite the disapproval
of Mr. Masefield&#8217;s Dauber, I will maintain
to give room and verge enough to annotate, parody,
wilfully miscomprehend, skip, doze, and indulge what
trains of thought whether ethical, fanciful, or reminiscent.</p>

<p>A gentler air, a bluer sea, a sandy coast in view.
There was something lyrical about the &#8220;dirty ship&#8221;
as with the buoyancy of her cargoless holds she
fleeted to the south. Mead, his future resplendent
with £1,166 and its South Sea bubble, seemed to feel
this rhythmical impulse. Every now and then, in
his consultations, he would break forth into singing,
but seldom more than a fragment at a time; now it
was &#8220;Farewell and adieu to you, bright Spanish
Ladies&#8221;&#8211;a grand old tune&#8211;now &#8220;Six men dancing
on the dead man&#8217;s chest.&#8221; But most, he gave in
honour of his native Australia a ballad of a monitory
sort with a wild yet sweet refrain. It began</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>I was born in the city of Sydney,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;And I was an apprentice bound,</p>
<p>And many&#8217;s the good old time I&#8217;ve had</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In that dear old Southern town.</p>
</div>

<p>The apprentice fell in with a dark lady&#8211;indeed &#8220;she
came tripping right into his way.&#8221; It was an
unfortunate encounter. He became her &#8220;darling
flash boy.&#8221; He could readily put the case against
her when, as receiver of stolen goods, he had served
some years in jail; and then, like the author of
<i>George Barnwell</i>, he addressed apprentices on the
subject:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>So all young men take a warning and</p>
<p>Beware of that black velvet tie.</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>But yet, and here was the charm of the ballad, and
the token of his entanglement by Neæra&#8217;s hair, ever
and anon came the burden</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>For her eyes they shone like the diamonds,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought her a Queen of the land,</p>
<p>And the hair that hung over her shoulders was</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Tied up with a black velvet band.</p>
</div>

<p>When Mead later on gave me a copy of this song,
which I shall not forget, duly set out in &#8220;cantos,&#8221; he
was good enough to ornament it with a little picture
of the black bow as tailpiece.</p>

<p>The heat became very strong, and as the day
declined, a great cloud-bank rose up out to sea, and
the air settled to that stillness in which the fall of the
ripples from the side sounds most insistent. Dark
came on, and from two arches or caverns of smouldering
twilight under the extremities of that mighty
cloud the lightnings burst; lightnings in whose
general wide waft of brightness intense white wreaths
suddenly lived and withered, branches of fire stretched
forth and were gone; while in the opposite heaven
&#8220;like a dying lady,&#8221; went the horned moon.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the <i>Bonadventure</i> not slacking her
unusual speed came to a lightship; then (for this was
a pilot station) the engines thrashed up the water as
she man&oelig;uvred for the pilot&#8217;s most comfortable
approach. The boatmen came rowing him lustily out
to us; our rope ladder was lowered&#8211;at these moments
I was sensible of a sort of proud anxiety on the part
of all aboard, that such a detail should be carried out
with all despatch&#8211;and up he came. And after him,
a rope was asked for, and sent down; up came a great
stringful of fish, gleaming like the sea under the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>
moon; and once more the rope went down, and a
collection of jars which were at once thought to contain
wine was hauled on board. Then, from the boat
&#8220;Finish!&#8221; but she did not depart, making fast to
the <i>Bonadventure</i>. She circling about the lightship,
at length brought her companion within a stone&#8217;s
throw. Then the boat was cut adrift, and we went
on our way towards a line of buoys whose flashes lit
up the expanse ahead.</p>

<p>We came now close by the misty lights of a town
named Puerto Militar and further on those of Ingeniero
White, the little port of Bahia Blanca to which the
<i>Bonadventure</i> was actually bound, began to beckon.
About eleven the anchors were let go, and the pilot
retired to sleep; but I still stayed with Mead, regarding
dully the dull lights of our surroundings, and
consuming cocoa, and blessing the exhalation of the
continent which had first met me at sea some weeks
ago. Already fishing, the steward leaned over the
rail close by; he had often painted the angling at
Bahia Blanca in enthusiastic colours. However, he
seemed to catch nothing.</p>

<p>By this the moon, that had grown almost a giantess
as she stooped down the horizon, and had reddened
like a glowing coal to the last almost, was dwindling.
The orb became a beacon dying on a hill; then
dropped below the sky. The lightnings over the
quiet sea had almost ceased.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span><a id='link_19'></a>XIX</h2>

<p>I slept heavily, and when I got up, the <i>Bonadventure</i>
had moved into the channel towards Ingeniero
White, and was lying at anchor outside that place.
The scenery about us was of pleasing ugliness, worthy
of George Crabbe&#8217;s poetical painting. To seaward
there lay long stretches of mud, or banks of a sort
of grass&#8211;long layers of brown and green ending
at the frontier of a blue-grey rainy sky; and the
land was low, featureless (save for a mountain height
in the hazy interior) and dark. Close to our mooring
was the assemblage of motley huts and tenements,
galvanized iron roofs, tall chimneys, and more
notably the grain elevators, under which several other
steamers were lying. Above the salt marshes a
rainbow touched the clouds, and too soon the sun
was pouring upon everything a dazzling sultry
heat.</p>

<p>At breakfast the fish which the pilot had brought
aboard as a kindly offering during the night were
eaten, curried. This mode of serving them displeased
the Saloon. The steward, affecting to be in a philosophic
doze in his lair, could not fail to have heard
such scathing remarks as these:</p>

<p>&#8220;The nicest fish I&#8217;ve had down here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, spoiled.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wasted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why the devil must they go and camouflage it?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>&#8220;If it had been high we&#8217;d have had it neat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Must have curry and rice on Monday morning.
Mustn&#8217;t go outside the routine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you see, if they started on the wrong note
on Monday they wouldn&#8217;t be able to pick up the tune
for the rest of the week.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, it&#8217;s easy. Steak, steak, steak.&#8221;</p>

<p>We hurried our breakfast amid these criticisms,
as the port authority was expected. Towards nine
o&#8217;clock, all hands being assembled amidships, his
launch came to the foot of the gangway. Eight
sailors in white uniform rowed this launch. He
divested himself of his sword, came up, and went
inside Hosea&#8217;s quarters to &#8220;talk things over&#8221;; whereupon,
the parade broke up. The next event was,
we changed our mooring. As we passed to the
new tether, which was among several tramps as
ladylike as ourselves, I had my first experience
of the groaning, screeching and gasping noise which
the machinery of a dredger can make, as its buckets
come round on the endless chain and empty themselves
into the barge alongside. I wonder these
contrivances were not introduced during the Passchendaele
operations. They would have served two
purposes, that of keeping a good depth of water for
the infantry to swim through; and that of demoralizing
the enemy.</p>

<p>We remained only a few minutes in this new
position. Then we moved into a dock, lined with
warehouses as they appeared, under whose grey tin
roofs were stacked bags of grain in large profusion.
With much shouting and manipulating of ropes,
we got in, behind the steamer <i>Caxambu</i>; alongside
a framework of piles. On these, even the less accessible
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>
slanting timbers, many a ship&#8217;s name scrawled
in black or red paint, and often followed by the
date of the call, addressed the new-comer&#8217;s eye.
In these inscriptions the S&#8217;s, B&#8217;s, D&#8217;s, and 9&#8217;s, had
a tendency to be reversed. I thought that the
exotic poets and others who deny their readers capital
letters, apostrophes and so forth might here find
another inspiration. The medley of names included
such as the <i>Trebarthan</i>, the <i>King Arthur</i>, the <i>Alf</i>,
the <i>Olive</i>, the <i>Bilbao</i>. And the <i>Keats</i>; why <i>Keats</i>?
Apart from this mystery, I could not help contrasting
many of the names with those of the figure-head
days, and like the posy of a ring, some of them
came into my mind, from my reading, the <i>John
and Judith</i>, <i>Charming Nancy</i>, <i>Love and Unity</i>,
<i>Lancashire Witch</i>.</p>

<p>Here, the heat seemed to redouble, and the flies
to bite harder accordingly. For some time nothing
much happened. The Captain, after being visited
by the doctor, ship&#8217;s chandler and others, but not
such a swarm as on our previous berthing, went
ashore, leaving Bicker, who prided himself upon
his mathematical faculty, to wrestle with the problems
of the Customs manifest. I myself had handed
over trench stores; this looked a worse job, and
there were the familiar dilemmas of one thing with
different names.</p>

<p>The ship was not here, it soon showed, to take
her time. Loading began after dinner. A leather
band or rather gutter working on rollers was lifted
out from the wharf over each of several holds, and
a spout fixed at its extremity; the gang in charge
spread sacking under the feeding band and directed
the spout as they wished. Then the machinery
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>
behind began to drone, and the grain, like a gliding
brook, to travel along the leather band; whence,
at the overturn, it leapt into the spout which directed
its descent into the hold, while a sort of idle snowstorm
of chaff and draff glistened thick in the sunlight.
Many heads looked over the rails to see this
process at first, but there was a sameness about it
and the heads quickly found other occupation.
Presently I went to look at the activities behind
the scenes, where a gang was taking bags of grain
from a railway truck and emptying them through a
grating into another travelling conduit, which duly
under the flooring of the building bore the wheat
to the automatic machines. There, it seemed to
my inept wish to learn, it was amassed until a certain
weight was registered, and that point reached the
heap was flung forward into the feeder which ran
up to the spout over our hold. Before the yellow
current arrived there, it had been sampled at intervals
by a boy who squatted beside, dipping a horn-shaped
can on the end of a stick into it, and filling
thereby small labelled sacks convenient to him.</p>

<p>The Brazilian steamer ahead of us was receiving
the grain in bags, which looked oddly like pigs
asleep as they were hurried along the endless band.
On this steamer, the <i>Caxambu</i>, real live pigs and
sheep were routing about over the forecastle. I was
told that she was an ex-German. Anyway, though
in déshabille, she was a handsome ship. Her bell
was the most resonant; the <i>Bonadventure&#8217;s</i> was
known still more surely for a thin tinkler when that
gong rang.</p>

<p>For the settlement beyond, it was not conspicuous.
The spires of Bahia Blanca showed up white some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>
few miles inland; the nearer scene was one of tin
roofs, of railway coaches and wagons, small muddy
decks and mud flats. Naturally the steward was
fishing. But nothing was biting. He stood pensively
gazing into heaven, even holding the line listlessly,
when the third mate having collected a good attendance
crept up behind him as quiet as a cat and jerked
the line with the hungry violence of a monster,
contriving also to make his retreat out of sight
before the aged angler had quite decided that he
was <i>not</i> going to catch a huge bass. This heartless
deception was very popular. Something was necessary
to while away the evening despite its bright
array of dewy-lighted clouds, which suited the
coolness of the air. The grumble of the machinery
gave place to &#8220;Cock Robin&#8221; and other classic
opportunities for bawling; and cards were brought
out.</p>

<p>The next day, cold enough for every one, and
proving that the English climate is not alone in its
uncertain habits, went on quietly. The party who
brought the sacks of grain to the door of the railway
truck, the man who there at singular speed cut
away the string from the mouths of the sacks, the
lads who swept all loose grain from the truck and
its neighbourhood&#8211;all were working to load us as
if their lives depended on it. Actually, no doubt,
this was the case. The <i>Bonadventure</i> ceased to tower
aloft out of the water.</p>

<p>Bicker, Mead and the passenger-purser passed
the evening in the village. We went in and out
of shops in a casual manner. There was one whose
contents were sufficiently varied for the sailors&#8217;
fancy. On one wall hung a large collection of crudely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>
cured pelts, the fur of wild cats, foxes, and other
animals. From the ceiling hung, unpitied, many
canaries imprisoned in yellow cages; under the
counters were displayed baskets made of turtle
shells, lined with pink sateen. Cigarettes of all
nationalities, boot polishes of uncertain price and
utility, and in the window a regiment of notes and
coins advertising the money-changer&#8217;s department,
caught my eye. There were even old books. As
we were leaving two sailors entered bearing a cage
wrapped in paper. They accosted the fat and
greasy shopkeeper abruptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Canary eh? died &#8217;smornin&#8217; eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>(This &#8220;eh?&#8221; was the mainstay of our Anglo-Argentine
intercourse.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Ah, no give monjay!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, mucho plenty monjay.&#8221;</p>

<p>The question in short was, what about giving us
our money back?&#8211;but we could not stop long
enough to see the result. Further along, children&#8217;s
sandals were ranged in a window. Mead thought
that he would shine in a pair like them; but the
shopkeeper thought his inquiry for sandals size 9
a good joke.</p>

<p>At this stage, when Mead emerged, I was very
sorry to have to call his attention to a board in
the window, which in his concentration on the
sandals he had overlooked. It was a board giving
the numbers (announced that day) of the winning
lottery tickets. None of these numbers coincided
with that owned by Mead.</p>

<p>The disappointment quite naturally led us to the
refreshment room at the station and kept us there
until the hour of closing. The angry Mead in some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>
measure became reconciled to the injustice which
he had suffered, and we all enjoyed the friendliness
of the waiters. These, not being over busy, played
the fool, except one who behind the bar sat with
pen and ink and a folio blank-book laboriously
copying an English exercise on the ancient pattern:
Have you seen my glove?&#8211;Yes, I have seen your
glove, &amp;c. One endeavoured to persuade us that
he was a Russian, and feigned a horrid interest in a
news paragraph about Lenin. The other indulged
in an anti-French speech, with gestures. &#8220;La
Liberté!&#8221; he jeered, at the same time grasping
vigorously in all directions.</p>

<p>Our nights were disturbed by mosquitoes, not so
ferocious as formerly, and cats. Aboard, it still
seemed cold; but ashore there was little breeze,
and my walks round the town were warm work.
The outskirts of this ramshackle place were dreary,
but I liked them better than city streets. They
formed a loose encampment of tin, or plaster, or
matchboard, in which one would perhaps notice
most the open drains, the chickens, goats (some
of them of most sheepish appearance), cows, pigs,
cats, dogs of the silly sort, sunflowers, and gentlemen
in blue cotton trousers, about the thresholds.
Grumble as you may at militarism, most army camps
would have been better favoured in some respects:
since here, despite the prospects of mud suggested
by the dust of the present season, no hut seemed
to have a raised approach, whether stone causeway
or duck-walk. I never walked into Bahia Blanca,
though not far short of its tall spires, but found
these habitations a sufficient view; the way back
to the <i>Bonadventure</i> might be over a moorish level,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>
thickly grown over with yellow flowering weed, and
all sorts of drouthy &#8220;flora of the marsh.&#8221; Marsh,
however, it was not, the soil being thoroughly baked
and cracked. Here were a few birds, that seemed
to me the thrushes of the place; a few butterflies;
beetles, lying dead here and there; lizards in greater
number. But the fields hereabouts had all a solitary
look. Often the track was inches deep in dust.</p>

<p>On one of my walks, the wireless operator being
with me, we were seen going up from the wharf
by the ship&#8217;s carpenter, who, it afterwards came
out, had tried to attract our attention by shouting.
The reason for his attempt is interesting. He was,
in fact, at that time in &#8220;calaboosh,&#8221; having been
haled thither during the night, according to a prophecy
of Mead&#8217;s. Looking too long on the wine (three
glasses, by his reckoning) and the beer (one innocent
glass), he had succeeded in arriving abreast of the
Brazilian next to us. At this point, he had the
misfortune to lose the way to the <i>Bonadventure</i>;
and presently for his safety the police took him to
the cells. Thence, the next afternoon, Chips was
released, and that without even a fine. The winter
wind is not so unkind as this cadaverous man&#8217;s
ingratitude to the gendarmes for their kindly act.
Asked about it, he complained in loud and bitter
terms that such things should be, and</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with swinish phrase</p>
<p>Soiled their addition.</p>
</div>

<p>This episode appeared to please the mate, Meacock,
in no small degree. He recounted other imprisonments;
told of black sheep among crews newly
arrived from Sing Sing and similar haunts, for whose
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>
arrest a warrant was always handed to the police
as soon as the ship arrived in port; described the
difficulty of getting these incorrigibles from the
ship to the wharf, the police having no sanction
to touch them on the ship; and how the Brazilian
police got the upper hand of bruisers towering above
them by lambasting them with the flat of their
swords.</p>

<p>Lethargy and grain dust seemed to hang in our
air together. The exploration of Ingeniero White as
an amusement became less liked as time went on, and
as sometimes the dull sky broke in a drizzle of rain.
One hatch was filled with wheat; the gang trimmed
it quickly; and the loading of the other hatches
continued apace, so that our going to sea again
looked close at hand. The sailors and apprentices
with pots of paint were perched at various points
above and beside the ship; and it was no great
surprise to me when one of the boys, much given to
recreation, suddenly appeared in a waterlogged
state.</p>

<p>The town was not without its Mission to Sailors.
It depended upon the energies of a very small English
community, of course, but they kept up a comfortable
room, where dancing and singing were entered upon
in the evenings; the standards of pastime required
by Bicker and Mead, however, were not reached.
It pleased them to drift about; to call at the refreshment
room of the station and throw dice for drinks,
to prowl about the town with an independent air.
The funds at the disposal of this party were dwindling.
It was therefore proposed to take to the vile syrup
known as <i>caña</i> instead of whisky, and an ingenious
logic was discovered in favour of the plan, apart
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>
from the great cheapness of the caña. As thus:
Even at B.A. (did you but know it) you often had
turpentine sold you for whisky; in fact, here, if
you asked for whisky, ten to one that what you
received was caña at four times its proper price.
Better ask for caña straight away. This reasoning
in favour of an adopted plan could not be answered
except by sudden wealth. These driftings were
mainly spent in wondering what to do next. (The
only real prospect was, to get back to the ship.)
If any decision was made, it was a picturesque
one. For instance, the town being abed, we went
into a general stores where there was a light showing
the proprietor about to close. Somewhat to his
surprise, and after the first few moments to his
discontent, supper was taken, dog biscuits and cream
cheese, washed down with yellow caña&#8211;a more
inflammatory distillation even than the white. And
so home.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span><a id='link_20'></a>XX</h2>

<p>We did not get away so quickly as had been thought,
and as every one seemed to wish. Heavy skies
came on, giving the slack waters a leaden look. The
air, though it was not hot, was close; and the fine
dust from the grain which carpeted all the decks
began to sit heavy on the lungs. Among the business
outstanding remained that of stowing 7,500 bags
in the bunker hatch&#8211;slower work, clearly, than
the loading in bulk which had until now been the
method with the <i>Bonadventure</i>. Bicker and Mead,
as they supervised the trimming of hatches that
had been filled, wore a melancholy look, nor was the
entry at breakfast of two young men from the Customs,
though pleasant acquaintances, considered a relief.
If clouds disappeared, and left the day like a
furnace, there was every facility for doing nothing
at all. Even at evening the cabins were filled
with tepid air and flies: and most of us might be
found leaning over the rails in silence, watching
sunset&#8217;s orange red colour to the prime and die
away again in the sky and the water below it, scarcely
marked with a ripple; and then the moon riding
high above our bridge, itself not unexalted, not
ungraceful by its proximity to the warehouse. In
such a night comes Mead, and a consultation ends in
my approaching Mouldytop the steward with
respectful petition for ship&#8217;s biscuits. These soon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>
refreshed in my mind Solomon&#8217;s choosing a dish of
herbs and love over a stalled ox and hatred.</p>

<p>The time now arrived when I was honourably
appointed to a job of work. I felt proud indeed
when Meacock explained it to me. It was, to keep
count of the number of bags of grain shipped for the
bunker hatch and another one aft. The tallyman
employed by the merchants kept his record, shouting
out his &#8220;Una, dos, tres&#8221; until each tally of bags
was complete; the ship&#8217;s representative looked on
at the descending bags and made his oblique strokes
in his book accordingly. This work in effect was
not so simple as it sounds; sometimes after a pause
the bags would be let loose suddenly and in quick
succession, nor moreover was it possible to question
the other tallyman at the moments of disagreement,
since he spoke no English and I no Spanish.</p>

<p>This delivery of some thousands of bags was to
be completed in the course of a day, but was not.
The arrangement of shoots for the bags to travel
down was as neat as a scenic railway: they slid
down one, were deflected by a fixed bag at the foot
of it to another shoot at right angles to it, and so
on down to the caverns and the packers. The
day&#8217;s work ended, but some thousands of bags
remained to be put aboard, and I felt that I was
growing used to times and seasons nautical, &#8220;the
ways of a ship,&#8221; in the cook&#8217;s phrase. When a
sergeant-major says, Parade at 8.30, he is understood
to have ordered a parade for 8.15; but I suspect that
at sea, should the tramp be expected away this
week, next week is the actual time of departure.</p>

<p>Newspapers reached the ship from Buenos Aires,
one day old, and by that time having an antiquarian
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>
value of twenty centavos, or fourpence. In consequence
we generally went without; yet somehow
important news, such as the result of Cardiff City
versus Tottenham Hotspur, was quickly passed
round. Unimportant, such as the latest development
in the Anglo-Irish situation, was considered &#8220;politics,&#8221;
and its seeker ignored.</p>

<p>The wharves were haunted, it goes without saying,
by rats; more publicly, by dogs. One grey giant
was regarded, especially by the mess-room boy,
with romantic fondness. His history, if his, was
current. He was &#8220;a Yankee,&#8221; but had lost his
passage in the North American ship to which he
belonged; and now, it was maintained, he made a
complete round of all the docks, boarded every
ship that came in, and looked into the alleyways
to try and recognize his own. The dog did, I agree,
wear a saddened expression. But, discreetly, I did
not feel sure about his sentimental journey. It was
&#8220;Mess-room&#8221; too who encouraged a cat to prepare
for the homeward voyage, and I cannot say that
he at first appeared likely to persuade the animal,
which, shut in for the night, like Chips on a recent
occasion, gave vent to piercing miaows. Parrots
and monkeys, without which surely no sailor should
ever return to his native village, were alike scarce.</p>

<p>The subject of my future standing in the village
tavern had already been discussed when others failed.
It now arose again. The saloon&#8217;s ideas of rural
England were almost as broad as mine of sea life.
They could see or affected to see nothing else in
agriculture but one large joke; and its communities
as so many tribes of gaping lads in smocks, with
churchwardens, clustering about the oldest inhabitant.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>
I had told them not once nor twice that no one in
my village had any sense of distance, or wish to
travel, or to hear of travels. But still it was believed
that on my return I should be received at the inevitable
&#8220;Green Cow&#8221; or &#8220;Pig and Whistle&#8221; with
roars of applause, all mouths in the shape of O&#8217;s,
all attentions grappled to my lightest word. More
probably, I hinted, if I were to return and mention
as a news item a voyage in a tramp to South America,
the patronage would preserve a chilling silence, as
who should say, &#8220;We are too old for these youthful
frivolities. We are not amused&#8221;; and would then
resume the old buzz of &#8216;sheening and jack hares
and the riches of the rich&#8217;&#8211; But I was not heard.</p>

<p>Lightning, a passion with me, grew bright and
furious towards the end of our stay, about the fall
of darkness; in its blue flare, it was startling to see
how like a wreck a Swedish motor-ship, which had
put in because of a fire aboard, lay lonely at some
distance from us. Presently the rain came down
and cooled the air; the night grew quiet then,
the far thunder dying out, or if there was noise,
it was the cricket&#8217;s cry, and the gruff brief conversation
of the ship&#8217;s watchman with his comrade
on the wharf as he passed by.</p>

<p>Sunday came again, day of washing for Meacock
and others; day of eggs and bacon for the Saloon&#8217;s
breakfast, and with it special duff and crimson
sauce for dinner, tinned pineapple and cake for
tea. Fortified thus, Bicker and Mead and myself
go a-fishing on the opposite quay, where some Argentines
have been catching fine fish. Now it is, to the
best of my memory, the fact that I have never yet
caught one fish on Sunday; and so I should have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span>
been wiser than to have joined in this excursion.
Luck stopped dead as soon as we began, and to
make things worse, through a sleepy reply of Bicker&#8217;s
I imagined the line to be made fast to the jetty, and
threw out the sinker with special success &#8220;far out
at sea.&#8221; That line was not made fast. It had
belonged to the steward. He, when he heard the
disaster, stood in a kind of <i>rigor</i>, gazing at high
heaven as one insensible to misfortune.</p>

<p>And now came our last day at Ingeniero White.
Not too soon, it seemed; the scenery of the port
having but little of freshness, and the drama of loading
again lacking in situations. Mosquitoes here served
me well by arousing me in the early morning, as
I was instructed to take a hand at six with tallying
the bags of grain. I was there to the moment,
but my duty proved to be that of standing by,
enjoying life. At twelve, all hands were mustered
amidships and numbered by the port authority,
and one was missing. At length it was found out
who, namely, one Towsle the sleepiest of the apprentices,
and where&#8211;in his bath, dozing unaware of the
parade outside the door. The pilot came aboard at
three, and the tug <i>Lydia</i> presented herself to guide
the <i>Bonadventure</i> out: there was much business
with ropes fore and aft, and the ship swinging round
was free of the wharf about the top of the tide.
The warehouses with their stacks of bags, slippered
blue-trousered handymen, surpliced overseers with
their sampling hollow bayonets, railway trucks and
capstans, ubiquitous dogs and all, began to recede.
But we had not come more than a couple of miles
from the elevators, nor out of sight of the refugee-like
town behind them, when we anchored to await
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>
Hosea. At a considerable space from the town, all
alone, we saw as we waited the big drab square
building euphemistically known aboard as the
&#8220;variety show.&#8221; It was a sad sight, and to me in
its significance of some people&#8217;s luck in this world, a
challenge to my random cheerful philosophy, which
I have not yet been able entirely to dismiss.</p>

<p>Presently from the land a storm began to foreshadow
itself, and suddenly there was a burst of wild
piping wind, like a spiteful cry, that flung sharp rain
over us and in scarcely a minute had died down
again. Its short career sent every one interested
scampering to take in the canvas awnings, and left
a breeze which when the captain arrived in a launch,
carrying some newspapers, blew them round him
like a garment. He was wearing a straw hat. He
jammed it on with a will and hurried up the rope
ladder. With his return, we were at sea again, though
not yet in the open.</p>

<p>The evening was one of strange majesty. One saw
clouds amassing in every similitude of mountainous
immensity and ascent, and wild lights everywhere
burning among them; but most of all, a tawny
lion&#8217;s colour mantled in a great tract of the sky
and below shone dim yet in a manner dazzling
from the darkening water. The heat of the day
had been oven-like. Lightnings began after a red
weeping sunset, sheet lightnings often veined with the
fiercest forks of white flame, wreaths of golden fire,
volleys, cataracts, serpents; and these danced about
the horizon until daybreak, sometimes in silence,
sometimes with deep but weary-sounding thunderclaps.
The light that these wanderers cast was
often of an intensity scarcely credible. A deluge of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>
rain was always imminent, but only towards dawn
arrived.</p>

<p>The <i>Bonadventure</i> had been, under these innumerable
lights, making quiet way down an avenue of buoys
twinkling in their degree, and came into view of the
lightship beyond them. The pilot sounded the siren
(for he was to leave us here), and in reply to the
second call of the siren the lamp of a boat pulling
out towards us appeared. It was good-bye to the
pilot and his bag, which on the end of a rope now
caused a moment&#8217;s interest; the engines, stopped
to let him depart, were started again, and the captain
fixed the ship&#8217;s course. Mead&#8217;s watch, as usually it
was, shared by the purser, engaged us in more recollections
of the great war; and in the glitter first of a
swarm of dragon-flies, then presently the surly
gleam of the lightning, we talked on until midnight.
I admired him for having already forgotten all about
his disappointment in the lottery, and begun with
new hopes according to his motto; <i>Quo fata vocant</i>.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span><a id='link_21'></a>XXI</h2>

<p>The breakfast steaks were leathery past anticipations.
The flies in the cabin were thousands strong. But
the <i>Bonadventure</i> was homeward bound, and a
general spirit of liveliness prevailed. Conversation
was running much upon the value of the mark, for
it was to Hamburg that we were believed to be
going. Base hopes were expressed that the rate of
exchange might be a thousand to the pound. No
one imagined that this would some day be surpassed
by eleven thousand. The Argentine had been
expensive; the cheapness of Germany was thrown
up all the clearer. As, however, I had no anxiety to
buy a safety razor, mouth-organs, clocks, and pocket
manicure sets, to which and other articles like them
I imagined the German cheapness would be limited,
I was not elated on that score.</p>

<p>At any rate, here we were steaming north at a
steady speed, with a light breeze ahead, and the
coast of the Argentine slipping past, dimly seen.
And everything was bent for England. For weeks
the chief had expressed a longing for pancakes at
almost every meal; and now, auspicious, they
came. On the other hand, the cheese was done.
Dark suspicions about a certain cake were also
whispered; knowing ones, whose information was
that Hosea had sent one aboard from Bahia Blanca
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>
for the benefit of the saloon, saw villainy in the delay
of its forthcoming. When it did appear its pomp
of white icing and green and red crescents, and
diamonds of fruit ornaments, certainly warranted
an anxiety, as for crown jewels.</p>

<p>Meacock, the ever-busy and never-flustered, about
this time showed me his private notebook, in which
he had from time to time copied verses and aphorisms,
chiefly from <i>Nash&#8217;s Magazine</i>, which he considered
worthy. In this anthology of his I might have seen
the signs of a literary revival aboard which shortly
afterwards befell. I daresay he would have expanded
a remark of his, &#8220;Novels were untrue to life, but
life was not by itself interesting enough&#8221; (during
the war he had commanded a trawler in the Mediterranean),
had not the slow flash of a lighthouse appeared
on the port side. He climbed to Monkey Island to
take a bearing. The blurred lights of Mar del
Plata past, our course was altered to agree with the
set-back of the coast. Mead came up for his watch,
eight bells went, and Meacock departed. His &#8220;Ay,
ay&#8221; to the retiring steersman&#8217;s report, the apprentice&#8217;s
reading of the log, and the forward lookout&#8217;s shout
&#8220;The lights are bright, sir,&#8221; always had a handsome
resonance and lingering dignity.</p>

<p>Mead was by this time full of Hamburg, and he
kept breaking into songs in very low Low German, and
memories of one Helen, not without sighs. That
romance was not the first, nor the last, which I heard
from him. He would show me Hamburg! and
by way of a Pisgah look, he drew gay pictures of
that town, omitting however its architectural glories.
Like critics of nature poetry, he saw the world in
terms of men and women: and Hamburg as the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>
location of dancing saloons and a singular exhibition
of waxworks.</p>

<p>The evening had at first looked stormy, and sharp
fits of lightning lit the low clouds, but all passed
by. The clear and cool heaven was left, diamonded
with steady constellations, and crowned with the
round moon &#8220;and a star or two beside&#8221;; below
like a field of silver lay the sea, and the quiet ship
flung by veils of lily foam, and the shadows
stealthily counter-changed the glistening decks. In
these calm airs and waters, she made such good speed
that the next afternoon we came in view of Monte
Video. The pilot took over the bridge, and we
were soon at anchor in the harbour, which seemed
thronged with ships. Our business here was to
load bunker coal, and as our coal was at the moment
aboard a collier which was to be seen some distance
out of the breakwaters, nothing was done this first
evening. The news that his coal was yet to arrive
at Monte Video was cheerfully imparted to Phillips
with the comment, &#8220;Well, anyway, chief, you&#8217;ll
get your coal nice and fresh&#8221;; but he seemed
by no means consoled. Nor did the assurance of the
shipping clerk&#8211;a somewhat lilified young man in
immaculate blue serge&#8211;that &#8220;Our Cardiff house
have let us down badly,&#8221; act as a charm upon his
depression. He told me to stand by for the office
of tallying at seven the next morning, and I thanked
him. The request implied, perhaps, the paternal
anxiety for my avoiding mischievous indolence which
he had shown before.</p>

<p>But meanwhile what was there to do? We lay
at a distance from the shore, and had therefore
no distraction. I watched the lighthouse on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>
hill, the buoys, the ship&#8217;s signals, the trams on the
quay, the other illuminant causes all round us; I
listened to a brass band which, for whatever reason,
was playing close to the harbour until late in the
evening; and then, driven to extremes, I sat down
to write a &#8220;novel&#8221; which became my refuge from
ennui during what remained of my holiday, but
which I fear will never be finished. I spoke to Mead
about it. He thought little of my hero. I agreed to
have the hero killed in a bayonet fight near Alberta
pill-box, but he thought I might go still nearer to
propriety and have the hero kill his man, and
go through his pockets. There did seem something
in this suggestion, and a few years ago such an
ending as it conjured up would have been popular,
I think:</p>

<div class='bquote'>
<p>&#8220;The battle was over. Whistling &#8216;Tipperary,&#8217; and
placing the wallet and watch of his prostrate antagonist
in the pocket of his body shield, Arthur strode
onward to join his comrades at their evening meal
in Houthulst Wood. Here let us leave him, calmly
facing the morrow as only an Englishman can.</p>
</div> <!-- block quote -->

<div class='center'>
<p>&#8220;THE END.&#8221;</p>
</div> <!-- centered -->

<p>The next day brought the worst weather that we
had met since we left the Channel. At first it was
merely cool and mild; but that was misleading.
Down came the rain, thick, cold, and steady; and there
seemed a sufficient supply to last until we left. I
noticed it, myself, with more especial observation, at
my post of tallyman.</p>

<p>In the drizzle the lighters came alongside bringing
the coal in bags. The stevedore&#8217;s gang and their
own overseers arrived aboard. One of these overseers
was an Englishman, who by his manner and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>
speech had evidently been brought up in a widely
different setting; but it was none of our business,
though Bicker and others considered it a disgrace for
an Englishman to be so employed. All I heard was
that he came from the West of England, and that
he was wild (which appeared sufficiently in his
countenance); and I admired his intellect, and tried
to make him feel that. The other overseer was a fat
old Italian, who tallied with me for the lighter on the
port side.</p>

<p>As these men and the poor fellows who were
emptying the sacks into the hatches or trimming
the coal down below had been at work all the night,
it was not surprising that our affairs moved slowly.
The winch, steaming and thudding and jerking in a
mutinous mood, brought up four bags at a time, on
my side. The sling that held them was lowered to
the deck, the hands rushed to swing them on to the
improvised platforms beside the hatches, with a
concerted roaring as if over the capture of a tiger.
While these bags were being emptied, the sling
would be descending into the lighter again; and
so it continued, with a fog of coal particles wrapping
the neighbourhood. The gang was a mixed multitude.
Nationality might have been anything. The prevailing
colour was a sable (unsilvered), under which
mask might be distinguished Italian, Portuguese,
Japanese, West Indian, and other types. Among
the most energetic of those who were emptying the
bags, the most vocal of the roarers, there was a tall,
thin, humorous fellow who reminded me irresistibly
of a brilliant poet and miscellanist of the modern
school. I thought of that dazzling smile, that
æsthetic face transferred to the surroundings of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>
Chelsea, and what a success, if looks meant anything,
he ought to be! So strongly did I feel that in his
hours of leisure and coallessness he was a critic of
verse and <i>m&oelig;urs</i> that I almost asked him his name.</p>

<p>My co-tallyman was pleasantly disposed. He
asked me if I would give him one of several casks
standing near the galley. I referred him to Phillips,
who referred him to Meacock, who referred him elsewhere.
We disagreed now and then over the tally,
but I was able to hold my own. The <i>lex talionis</i>
was in force. Sometimes I was induced to accept his
surplus over my figure as accurate, but then I would
take him back at another opportunity, and ignore
his doleful &#8220;Make it <i>threeee</i>.&#8221; My imagination
lagged behind his, which seemed to see occasional
slings put aboard by aerial hands, and aerial coal
at that, and these went down in his book. But
altogether we &#8220;made it.&#8221; Mutual mistrust served
the public good.</p>

<p>The chief lent me a boiler suit, for which I was
insufficient, and added an old macintosh presently.
I soon grew black; even the tallyman, though he
seemed to have some natural gift in his stubbled
skin which repelled the grime, grew black. Presently
I was disguised in the order of things as a film thug,
with waterlogged cap sagging over eyes heavily inlaid
in blackness. Tired as the labourers must have
been, they went on working as if they liked it, grinning,
singing, enjoying comments upon each other, and
refreshing themselves with cheroots, cigarettes, peaches,
or sups from cans containing a brown decoction like
strong tea. They ceased at four.</p>

<p>It was by way of variation in the evening that
Bicker and Mead fell upon me, with the idea
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>
of shampooing the begrimed tallyman. Zambuk
(Hosea&#8217;s trusted salve), lime cream, and talcum
powder were employed. There was a struggle,
however, which disturbed Meacock opposite. He
came to the rescue, but leaping upon the two barbers,
who were holding me down, he forgot that I was
underneath. &#8220;Rough house,&#8221; the word went round.</p>

<p>When the stevedore&#8217;s men arrived the following
day, they were almost to a man rigged out in the
cleanest of suits, or costumes rather. This was, to
the best of my information, not the habit with the
British trimmer. Their hats were pleasing to the
eye. In his jet-black felt, my poetry-critic looked
the picture of a member of the <i>Athenæum</i> staff
(lamented <i>Athenæum</i>!). Others wore the type of
hat but not the manner. A number of matey caps,
check and khaki and indigo, then white wideawakes
as though for haymaking, and a few pillbox-like
creations in crimson and daffodil, made part of the
splendour. Some of the coalheavers wore large
sashes amidships, sashes of lurid colour also, violet
and plum, extra shade. In the shirts, more colour
appeared. Here, like Aurora, stepped Antonio in
salmon pink; there, was a construction of red and
green rings on a white background. The bright-blue
cotton suits added to the general effect. Curious
that these workers should come so clean, only to
be coated with coal-dust in half an hour! It spoke
well for their outlook.</p>

<p>The work was much as before. Wheelbarrows
had to be got to put the sacks beside other hatches
which the winch did not command. The chief had
some argument with the Italian foreman about the
last two hundred bags, which he wished to be shot
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span>
into the starboard hatch only, to bring the ship
up straight. The foreman asked him to withdraw
this. &#8220;Damn you!&#8221; roared Phillips, and put an
end to the matter, &#8220;when I say <span class='sc'>NO</span> I mean <span class='sc'>NO</span>.
Don&#8217;t you understand plain English?&#8221;</p>

<p>So that was that, and my job finished. The
bosun and his worthies quickly gathered to remove
the disgraceful signs of bunkering; they swept and
garnished, the stylish shipping clerk came aboard with
his final papers to see Hosea and Phillips. Already
the pilot was on the bridge; soon we were slowly
backing away from our mooring. The blue peter
was hauled down, the gangway got in. The <i>Bonadventure</i>
was man&oelig;uvred past the breakwaters
and down the marked channel, at whose last buoy,
or soon afterwards, the tug to fetch the pilot came
alongside. As he withdrew in her she sounded
the three blasts or rather hoots meaning a &#8220;Bon
voyage,&#8221; and our own burly voice sounded three
times in acknowledgment. The many turrets and
spires, chimneys and gaunt roofs of Monte Video,
distinctly ranged along a rainy sky with shelves of
rock-like cloud, lessened duly; the evening came on.
Still the coast appeared here and there, its yellow
sands, its dark-blue cliffs and hills, and as if shouldering
the dull and heavy sky the sun burned out with a
golden power before he departed.</p>

<p>Mead bade good-bye for a short time&#8211;in all
probability&#8211;and myself for a long time, to South
America, still symbolized by its lighthouses and the
night-glow of a seaside town or two. Once again I
felt a regret that I had not seen the elder Buenos
Aires, whose extinction was no doubt a wise thing,
but which surely must have triumphed as a thing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>
of beauty over the present cubic blocks of utility.
Mead was not sentimental about going to sea once
more. He was too deeply engaged with devising a
piece of invective against an enemy for an alleged
injury, and immersed in the troubles of rhyme.
I thought he was acquitting himself very well.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span><a id='link_22'></a>XXII</h2>

<p>I have mentioned a scarcely concealed feeling in the
saloon against the omniscience of the wireless operator.
That was not all the opposition to which this youth of
the glazed locks was subject. He was understood,
while the ship was at sea, to receive news issued daily,
and frequently when a subject was being discussed by
the ship&#8217;s officers he sat there in possession of the facts
but with serene indifference to the general interest. In
this, he was carrying out the regulations, I imagine;
but his behaviour resembled that of the dog in the
manger. To aggravate this sense of injustice, he
rashly told some one that the news might be taken at
three guineas.</p>

<p>This in the first place affected the saloon only. But
it happened that throughout the ship there was a
particular desire for information. At home, the football
season was at its zenith. Important matches, in
the Leagues and the Cup competition, were known to
be playing; and one man on the ship when she was
out at sea could, and it was believed did, hear the
results. But never a word said he. Looking in at the
galley during the evening to brew my cocoa, I would
find animated discussion of the favourite teams in progress.
Kelly, the &#8220;Mess-room,&#8221; would wipe his fist
across his mouth and huskily explain. &#8220;It&#8217;s like
this, mister.&#8221; He had known other wireless operators
who gladly announced the football results. But this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>
fellow&#8211;he was too b&#8213; stuck-up, mister&#8211;&#8220;The
Marconi,&#8221; the term which he used for the offending
operator, savoured queerly of the phrase &#8220;The
Bedlam&#8221; in <i>King Lear</i>.</p>

<p>Such was the background against which Mead&#8217;s
vision of the unfortunate Sparks stood out, and with
the particular unfriendliness which I must briefly
describe. Earlier in the trip, Sparks had, in Mead&#8217;s
opinion, adopted a tone of equality and then even of
command towards him, in the course of the ship&#8217;s
routine. Mead had immediately resorted to warlike
acts. Sparks lodged a written complaint with Hosea,
who gave both parties the best advice. But it was a
false step in Sparks to send in this communication,
which would if forwarded have cost Mead, perhaps, his
living; and it was made worse by Sparks&#8217;s glib
defence, &#8220;I was doing my duty,&#8221; since he had been at
a safe distance from the war when Mead&#8217;s duty lay on
the Gallipoli beaches. And he still affected to think of
upholding his letter.</p>

<p>Matters were therefore strained, and the more they
were so the more Mead liked it. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let me catch
you ashore,&#8221; had been his way of passing Sparks the
time of day in port; at sea, he growled abuse at him
whenever he saw him, and if no better occasion offered
itself, would suddenly thrust his face in all the semblance
of murderous intention through the open porthole
of the young man&#8217;s room and utter calm, deliberate,
and unnatural purposes.</p>

<p>In this feud, my position was not comfortable.
Unlicked as he was (up to the present) and devoid of
fine points, the Marconi, whose cabin was neighbour to
mine, wished me no harm, and even sought my esteem.
Mead, whom I did esteem, was discontented with any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>
half-measures on my part, and in any case I felt bound
to observe neutrality. But the capers of my angry
friend were often amusing, the declarations of duty
conscientiously executed by his <i>bête noir</i>&#8211;Mead had
a weakness for style&#8211;were not. And it is scarcely
necessary to repeat, the general view of Sparks was not
a moral support to Mead even if he had &#8220;no case.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the occasion that I described, Mead had decided
to drive his point well home with the aid of rhyme. I
took a copy of his somewhat indecorous production.
It had many &#8220;spirited couplets,&#8221; embodying considerable
observations:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>To see you promenade the deck</p>
<p>Gives me a pain in my ruddy neck.</p>
</div>

<p>Sparks had been unwise, again, in mentioning his
pleasure in the slaughterer&#8217;s trade, and past experience.
Mead did not miss the opportunity.</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>If the blood of sheep could make you glow</p>
<p>Come and dare to make mine flow.</p>
<p>I am no hero out for gore,</p>
<p>I had the wind up in the war.</p>
</div>

<p>Names and menaces came fast and furious.</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>... Flowers there&#8217;ll be which you won&#8217;t smell,</p>
<p>You swob, you&#8217;ll learn a lot in hell.</p>
<p>Had I been called half these things</p>
<p>Some one or I&#8217;d be wearing wings.</p>
</div>

<p>This effusion, laboriously printed in <span class='sc'>Capitals</span> so that
its effect on the recipient should be the more demoralizing,
headed <span class='sc'>The Answer</span>, and signed in characteristic
fashion <span class='sc'>Nulli Secundus</span>, was to have been handed to
its theme in the saloon. Eventually, Mead rejected
that as perhaps contrary to tradition, and handed it in
at the porthole aforesaid; but its object, the arranging
of &#8220;a little bout,&#8221; was not achieved.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span><a id='link_23'></a>XXIII</h2>

<p>A literary epoch began. Bicker, our authentic poet,
and not an opportunist like Mead, had been proposing
a magazine for some little time past. On a Saturday
afternoon, he decided to produce the first number for
the Sunday following. The circulation was to be six:
there being no aids aboard such as the clay or hectograph,
each copy had to be written by hand throughout.
Into this labour I, with the editor&#8217;s satirical
comments upon my profession, was at once pressed.
Material in prose and verse was given to me, and filled
three foolscap pages in a close handwriting. I copied
out these contributions, which scarcely stood the test
of a second reading, six times: and was rewarded with
a vile headache. I hoped the magazine would
succeed, but only once. Bicker, like a born editor,
copied out his portion without feeling any the worse,
and his appreciation of the fare which he was providing
grew with every copy.</p>

<p>The final details, however, delayed the appearance
of the <i>Optimist</i> until Sunday afternoon. Bicker said
in self-protection that no Sunday paper is available in
the provinces before breakfast. When the <i>Optimist</i>
was published, there was no question of its being welcomed.
It was of the familiar kind, which seems to
satisfy enough readers to satisfy its promoters. A
fable in a dialect generally considered a skilful parody
of the Old Testament, &#8220;Things we want to know,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>
reports of the football season at Buenos Aires, Answers
to Correspondents, a poetical libel beginning &#8220;It is an
ancient Mariner,&#8221; and much besides, principally from
the editor&#8217;s pen, formed the bulk of it. There were
columns devoted to Amusements, and Advertisements
of the principal business heads aboard. A copy
made its way aft to the bosun and his sea-dogs&#8211;the
gentlemen who were announced in it as the Chain
Lightning Gang. Sitting on the poop in Sunday
neatness, they gave it a good reception. The bosun
himself had been ill, but was better after reading it.</p>

<p>With some copies a supplement was issued, and
collectors will not need to be advised to acquire
these rarities. This supplement was a page of
drawings, by Mead, of common objects at Buenos
Aires. The obese laundress, Mme. Maria Maggi, was
perhaps conspicuous among these (on another page a
report was printed that she had died, leaving £300,000
to her lean charioteer). The watchman, with a label
giving one of his typical blasphemies, &#8220;Got-a-d&#8213; b&#8213;&#8221; this, that, and the other, was seen at full
length. The altercation between the manager of the
wharf (attached to a balloon lettered <span class='sc'>You.are.using.my.Buckets. I.am.the.Bandoliero</span>) and Meacock,
smoking as always and nevertheless replying <span class='sc'>You.Big.Stiff</span> <i>ore rotundo</i>, was chronicled. And considering who
the artist was, and his recent poem, it was not surprising
to find a malevolent caricature of one still with us.</p>

<p>One afternoon, sleeping within my cabin, I heard
the mate altering the ship&#8217;s course with &#8220;Hard a starboard&#8221;
and so on, and feeling this to be out of the
ordinary I went out to see why. A mile off there was
something in the sea, which the apprentices declared
to be a small boat with a flag flying. I felt the light
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span>
of adventure breaking in upon the murky tramp.
But as we drew nearer, the castaway proved to be
nothing more than a buoy, and visions of picking up
a modern Crusoe faded suddenly. The ship was put
back to her course.</p>

<p>The breeze ahead grew stronger, and in the early
morning, the sky being quite grey, a slate-grey sea was
running in sizable crests and valleys and tossing the
spray high aboard. &#8220;The devil&#8217;s in the wind
already.&#8221; &#8220;And the bread.&#8221; The cook&#8217;s reputation
was gone at a blow. He, like a wicket-keeper,
did well without any notice taken; lapsed a moment,
and every one was barking. It seemed he had been
unfortunate in the yeast supplied him. There were
sallies of wit: &#8220;Now&#8217;s the time to pave the alley,&#8221;
&#8220;Pass the holystone,&#8221; over this doughy circumstance.
For some time, in the words of the Cambridge prize
poet, the bread &#8220;was not better, he was much the
same,&#8221; and ship&#8217;s biscuits became unexpectedly
favourite. They were stiff but excellent eating;
would have rejoiced the soul of my late general, the
noted &#8220;Admiral&#8221; H., alias &#8220;Monty,&#8221; alias &#8220;The
Schoolmaster,&#8221; and other aliases. Can he ever be
forgotten for those diurnal and immortal questions
of his, &#8220;Did your men have porridge this morning?&#8221;
and &#8220;Why did you not order your cook to give your
men duff to-day?&#8221; It wanted little imagination to
picture him under his gold oak leaves nibbling with
dignity at a ship&#8217;s biscuit and saying, &#8220;Very good,
Harrison, uncommonly tasty&#8211;I shall recommend
them to Division.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sea presently under a brightened sky grew to a
rare intensity of blue, that was at its most radiant in
the overswirl of water sheered by the bows. Gallant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>
enough the <i>Bonadventure</i> looked in the marvellous
expanse, having by dint of much early-morning swilling
and swabbing thrown the worst of her nighted
colour off; but almost every day I heard bad wishes
to the designer of her, though on the score of utility,
not the pleasure of the eye. My fancy of a full-rigged
ship bowing over these rich seas was usually
corrected with reference to &#8220;wind-bags&#8221;&#8211;not folks
like me, but ships.</p>

<p>Then there came rain, drizzling on doggedly hour
after hour. The drops hung on the railings like
autumn dews on meadow fences. One of the effects
of such weather was that the cat, who had been
induced after all to make the trip, was driven to look
about for a quiet, sheltered corner, and having found
one, was driven to look again. Finally she chose the
chart-room and settled upon the chart. South
America was sodden with rain and black with paw-marks
when the second mate looked in, and that cat,
black or not, would have passed over, but for her
being shortly to become a mother. That fact also
accounted for her worried expression, voice, and
manner, which I had misread as symptoms of sea-sickness.</p>

<p>And still the dull and rainy sky. When I went out
one morning, the mate leaned over the bridge rail
and said, &#8220;You&#8217;re the blooming Jonah! Now look at
that damn&#8217;d smoke.&#8221; I looked at the customary
coaly vapour flying aft, but was unenlightened.
&#8220;You Jonah,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;you&#8217;ve brought this
wind, and it&#8217;s carrying the cinders all over my new
paint.&#8221; Now, I suspected the cat was the cause of
the trouble; but my guilt was urged by the chief also,
as a current of a mile an hour was setting us back.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span>Not only the mariners of the <i>Bonadventure</i> lived in
suspense, awaiting the football results.</p>

<p>&#8220;That fellow was funny this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you could see the excitement in his lamp.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, about four the So-and-so passed us, and
the mate on watch signalled us: &#8216;Do you know the
result of Tottenham v. Cardiff City?&#8217; So we sent
back that Cardiff had won but we didn&#8217;t know the
score. This fellow sent back: &#8216;Oh, well done, Cardiff!&#8217;
but he was that excited, he could scarcely hit out a
letter right. His first message had been&#8211;well,
beautifully sent; now his lamp was all over the
place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We could almost see him dancing about the
bridge!&#8221;</p>

<p>Spragg, the assistant steward, sometimes came to
swab my cabin. He had been in a battalion of the
38th Division, when my own Division relieved them in
January 1917 on the Canal Bank at Ypres; and he
had been like myself a witness and a part of the
mammoth preparations of that summer, which ended
in such terrible failure. His manner and humorous
way of telling tales beside which the &#8220;Pit and
Pendulum&#8221; appears to me an idle piece of pleasantry,
unspeakably brought back the queer times and places
which we had both seen. I saw him in my mind&#8217;s
eye, keen and frank, standing behind his kit with
&#8220;headquarters company&#8221;&#8211;those amiable wits&#8211;at
Elverdinghe Château (Von Kluck&#8217;s rumoured country
seat, for it was never in my time bombarded); or
with pick or shovel stooping along in the Indian file
of dark forms towards that vaunted, flimsy breastwork,
Pioneer Trench at Festubert.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>But still my share of Mead&#8217;s watch was my best
recreation. Our talk was disturbed but little; perhaps
by the signals of some ship passing by, or by some
unusual noise, such as one evening we heard with a
slight shock. A succession of rifle-shots, it sounded;
and the cause was evidently some great fish departing
by leaps and bounds from the approach of that
greater one the <i>Bonadventure</i>. The interruption over,
he would go on with plans for a future in Malay.
&#8220;This life,&#8221; he would say, &#8220;is killing me.&#8221; He was
quite as healthy, mind and body, as any man aboard.
I liked his occasional rhapsodies, in which the smell of
burning sandalwood and of cotton trees, the clearings
in sinister forests with the jewelled birds, the rough
huts, the dark ladies with the hibiscus flowers in their
hair, and the lone white settler (ex-digger Mead)
thinking his thoughts in the evening, all played their
part. He wished the world back in 1860; it had
outdistanced him.</p>

<p>It blew from the north-east strong against us always,
and we were travelling more slowly. The sun returned,
however, among those ethereal white clouds which
to perfection fulfil the poet&#8217;s word &#8220;Pavilions&#8221;;
we ran on into a dark sea ridged and rilled with
glintering silver, yet seemed never to reach it, remaining
in a bright blue race of waters scattered, port and
starboard, with white wreaths, waters leaping from
the heavy flanks of the ship in a seethe of gossamer
atoms and glass-green cascade.</p>

<p>The immediate scene was one of painters and paint-pots,
and linen flying on the lines. &#8220;This wind&#8217;s
playing hell with my curls,&#8221; said one or two. The
matter with me was, that my room was almost untenable.
I opened the port at my peril; to do so was to
entertain billows of coal-dust from the bunkers below.
White paint, the order of the day, whether flat white
or white enamel, made progress about the ship by an
amateur dangerous, too.</p>

<p>The apparition of the steward under the evening
lamps dressed in a smock&#8211;he was of ample make&#8211;and
brandishing a paint-brush, was generally enjoyed.
In fact, several spectators came to take a careful look
at one who was too often denominated &#8220;the mouldy-headed
old b&#8213;.&#8221;</p>

<p>A more tenuous apparition was heard of, as we
ran north. Whether a hoax or not, I do not know.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>
My first information of it came in the form of a
drawing by the apprentice Tich, showing the ship&#8217;s
bell being struck by a hand who never was on land or
sea, and the apprentice Lamb leaving his hold of the
wheel in horror, and even Mead shaking all over and
gaping. A poem appended said that the facts were
what the picture made out. The <i>Bonadventure</i> was
so new a ship&#8211;her old name, showing her war origin,
still stood on the bells and the blue prints in the chart-room
and elsewhere&#8211;that there seemed every likelihood
against the story being the truth. I asked
Mead, and he told me what he maintained to be true.</p>

<p>On the first watch, the voyage before this, he had
gone into the wheel-house for a word with the apprentice
at the wheel. A shadow, indistinct, yet leaving
impressed on his recollection a human shape, slipped
suddenly past the wheel-house windows, softly rang
the bell once, and swiftly departed. The frightened
boy drops the wheel, lets the ship swing round completely
out of her course: Mead runs out, but there is
nothing to be seen. He sends for the two A.B.&#8217;s who
might have come up on the bridge, but they say
that they have not done so, nor indeed would they
come without object. The firemen, if they have to
communicate with the bridge, never come higher
than the stairway to the bridge deck, and it proved
that no one of them had been there. By the wheel-house
clock, it was noticed that the precise time of the
visitation was 10.15, an hour not hitherto regarded by
ghosts, I believe, as preferable to midnight.</p>

<p>And more. Still imagining that some practical
joker was at work, Mead brought a big stick with him
on his watch. This was no remedy. The ghost
appeared again, at much the same hour, on several
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>
nights; it was remarked, mostly when the apprentice
who first saw it had the wheel. Trying to stop so
strange a bell-ringer, Mead was met by a sharp flap
of wind, from a dead still night, and the glimmering
shadow was gone to the air. All this happened north
of the line.</p>

<p>This was Mead&#8217;s story, but the boy&#8217;s seemed to
support it; and when in the shadows of the bridge
deck, earnestly and without trimming, he told it
me, it seemed very true. I glanced about me occasionally
after hearing it.</p>

<p>The wind continued, but the heat was becoming
intense. Painting went on like the wind. The
derricks received a terra-cotta coat and their trellis
work looked an amenity, against the general whiteness.
The fervour for redecoration even affected
me: was not my hutch to share the common lot?
But, though the walls needed it, the matter was postponed,
on account of the limited accommodation.</p>

<p>The newspaper was to appear again, but its circulation
was being cut down. One copy only would now
have to serve the public. It was passed to me, and
my aid with paragraphs requested. I could not
regret the reduction made in the number, even though
if that one copy was lost,</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>We knew not where was that Promethean torch</p>
<p>That could its light relumine.</p>
</div>

<p>Bicker, the editor, instead of reviewing his admired
literature in his journal, lengthened breakfast by
doing so there <i>viva voce</i>. He was all for B&oelig;otian
situations, and, on occasion, his cold re-dishing was
tactfully ended by a relief conversation on religion,
the keynote of which was in the unironically meant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>
remark: &#8220;He was darned religious, but he was a
darned good man.&#8221; I began to know a certain captain,
from talk during the voyage, almost by sight; one
who &#8220;went in for Sunday Schools, and put on a
crown of glory as soon as he reached Wales,&#8221; but once
away again, it appears that &#8220;he fell.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another matter for the columns of the <i>Optimist</i>
was obtruded upon the breakfast table. It was a
conundrum:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>West was the wind, and West steered we,</p>
<p>West was the land. How could that be?</p>
</div>

<p>The answer, apart from such evasions as &#8220;You were
entering port,&#8221; was that West was the name of the
helmsman. It was understood that the poem went
on in this strain, but the chief&#8217;s protest came in
time.</p>

<p>The cat (last heard of in disgrace), which was under
the especial care of the mess-room boy, was no doubt
pleased hereabouts by our reaching the regions of
flying-fishes; but nevertheless continued, on the
gospel truth of Kelly, to take a chair in the engineer&#8217;s
mess at the critical hours of twelve and five. I
myself saw her there at twelve once or twice, judging
the time, no doubt, by the parade of table-cloth and
cutlery.</p>

<p>Without any abatement of the stuffy heat inside
our cabins, we ran into a rainy area. The sea was
overcast, and the showers splashed us well. Meanwhile,
the wind had veered round more to the east,
and besides bringing the grey vapours of rain tumultuously
towards us thence, set the spray flying over
the lower decks and kept us on the roll. Blowing on
the beam, however, it seemed to please Phillips,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span>
ever anxious about the hourly ten knots, which
seemed too high an expectation. Squalls threatened;
it was a tropical April mood. The rolling influenced
my sleep, in which I fancied myself manipulating the
airiest pleasure-boats, overcrowded with passengers
who refused to sit down, on an angry flooded river.</p>

<p>The peaceful disposition of the four apprentices
began to weigh upon Mead&#8217;s mind. A very happy
and orderly set they were, although the current
<i>Optimist</i> contained an illustrated article on the bosun&#8217;s
tyranny, as:</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class='sc'>Youse</span> take them two derricks for&#8217;ard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class='sc'>Youse</span> jes&#8217; pick up that ventilator, you flat-nosed
son of a sea-cook.&#8221;</p>

<p>The drawings of the well-known walrus head under
the antique, unique grey (<i>né</i> white) one-sided sugar-loaf
hat, were admirable. But to proceed. The
four boys were of the best behaviour, occasionally,
indeed, laughing or playing mouth-organs at
unpopular hours, or even after the nightly exit of
the cook making flap-jacks, otherwise pancakes,
from his properties in the galley. When I joined
Mead on his watch, one Sunday evening, he began
to &#8220;wonder what the boys are coming to.&#8221; They
were not like the boys of his time. He delved into
his own apprentice autobiography, and rediscovered
an era, a blissful era of whirling fists, blood, and booby
traps.</p>

<p>A day followed remarkable for the weather. A
swell caused the ship to roll with a will all day, but,
as was expected in the doldrums, the wind slackened.
After a few hours of this lull, there was a piping
and groaning through all the scanty rigging that
the steamer owned, and from farther out to sea the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>
grey obscurity of violent rainstorm, much as it had
done on our way south, bore down upon us. Soon the
ship was cloaked close in a cloud of rain pale as snow,
which flecked the icy-looking sea, veined white alongside
us, with dark speckling bubbles. Then it was
time to sound the whistle, and its doleful groan went
out again and again (the wind still varying its note
from a drone to a howl) until the fiercer sting of the
rain was spent, and distance began to grow ahead of
the ship. This storm lacked thunder and lightning;
and yet, when Sparks invited me to listen to his
&#8220;lovely X-s,&#8221; there was a continuous and furious
rolling uproar in the phones. Then, as strange again,
as if at a nod that din came to a sudden stop, leaving
in the phones a lucid calm in which ship-signals rang
out clear.</p>

<p>At sunset of a day which washed off the new paint
as soon as (in the intervals) it had been put on, a
thin red fringe glowed along the horizon, making
me long for green hills and white spires; at night,
the stars from Southern Cross to Charles&#8217;s Waggon
were gleaming, but the sea lay profoundly black,
and upon it all round us came and went glory after
glory of water-fire. The next day, however, it rained
in the same dismal style, and the sun&#8217;s eclipse and
the passing of Fernando Noronha were but little
heeded. I was called a Jonah by every one.</p>

<p>A mollyhawk, that evening, created some excitement.
He first spent some time in flying on an oval
course round the ship, for his recreation, it looked.
His beautiful curves must have pleased him as they
did me, for he persuaded (or so it appeared) another
mollyhawk to make the circuit with him. Meacock
and myself heard one of these strike against the wireless
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>
aerial, and thought that it would have scared
them away; but no, a few minutes later we heard
a croaking and a flapping while we stood in the lee of
the wheel-house, and there was a mollyhawk. He
had struck some low rope or fixture. He was prevented
by his webbed feet from rising again, and I
had fears for his future which were by no means
necessary; for Meacock followed him, an awkward
but speedy walker, down to the lower bridge deck,
and, fearing the swift white stabbing bill, waiting his
chance, suddenly caught at his nearest wing and
launched him into the air. If his speed could show
it, that bird was relieved.</p>

<p>This incident was a welcome verification of some of
the saloon&#8217;s bird anecdotes; and though it was nearly
dark and the bird was only aboard for two or three
minutes, his release was watched by a very good
gathering, representative of engineers, firemen, the
galley, sailors, and apprentices.</p>

<p>I must have made a good many references here and
there to the steward, old Mouldytop, and it occurs to
me that he deserves a paragraph to himself. Of this
ship, whom her most faithful lovers called a dirty
ship, with her short funnel pouring a greasy smoke
over her graceless body when even coal-dust rested&#8211;of
this grimy tramp, playing a sufficient part in the
world&#8217;s daily life, rolling and lurching up and down
oceans with fuel or foodstuff, thousands of tons at a
time, it may be safely said that the steward was the
feature. In the <i>Optimist</i> it was evident that he as
an inspiration excluded almost every other. In the
round of day and night, should he himself be unseen for
a time, his voice would generally claim your notice; if
conversation took on dark and prophetic tones, it was,
for a ducat, some restatement of the ancient&#8217;s wickedness,
and a realization of the strength of his position
against all the world. For behind Mouldytop was the
power of Hosea.</p>

<p>The steward was built somehow after the shape of
a buoy. It was Ireland, and not Scotland, that his
ancestors had left; but there was a doubt about his
own dialect. It was, and it was not, plain English.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>
His bulbous, melancholy face was topped with grey
hairs, but those he hid under his faded brown skull-cap.
Forty-nine years, one understood, had Mouldytop
been at sea; and before that, the veil of mystery
was thin enough to show him in his first stage, a batman
in the Army. This fact led him to deprecate
modern warfare, &#8220;It&#8217;s all science, Mister,&#8221; and those
who fought it; he claimed to have been blooded
<i>fighting</i> in some corner of the desert with spear-brandishing
multitudes. At the same time, he reserved
his reminiscences; for the refined insult, &#8220;You old
soldier,&#8221; needed no encouragement.</p>

<p>He seldom grew cheerful. I suppose that he was
happiest when some one (no doubt with serpent
tongue) asked how his cold was. Then, his roar
softened into a resigned murmur, as he recorded that
it was as bad as ever; that six bottles of his own
medicine taken regularly had not cured him. This
was a pleasure that he shared with the author of one of
the most melodious English songs, and it seems to be
prophetic of his appearance&#8211;</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>Welcome, folded arms and fixed eyes,</p>
<p>A sigh that piercing mortifies,</p>
<p>A look that&#8217;s fastened to the ground,</p>
<p>A tongue chained up without a sound,</p>
</div>

<p>as of his imaginative affections in his sombre cell&#8211;</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>A midnight bell, a parting groan!</p>
<p>These are the sounds we feed upon;</p>
<p>Then stretch our bones in a still gloomy valley,</p>
<p>Nothing&#8217;s so dainty sweet as lovely melancholy.</p>
</div>

<p>Let but a sailor apply to him at the wrong hour&#8211;or
even the right hour&#8211;for tobacco, and his indisposition
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span>
was gone in a second; his tongue was unchained.
The busy mockers grinned. &#8220;He&#8217;d tell Davy Jones
he&#8217;d been to sea before him.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the Argentine ports he was in excellent voice.
Did a native shoemaker come aboard with his repair
outfit, or a seller of fruit with his panniers, and did
any one propose to deal with these &#8220;Dagoes,&#8221; out
skipped our old friend, bellowing: &#8220;Too much, man;
what,&#8221; (<i>crescendo</i>) &#8220;d&#8217;ye think we pick up money in
the streets?&#8211;I wouldn&#8217;t have your blasted country
for all the blasted money there is in it.&#8221; The charges,
I am bound to add, fell down quickly, while the old
watchman standing by observed with a respectful
grin, &#8220;You a good man!&#8221;</p>

<p>The advance of age was a sore point with Mouldytop.
Consequently, it was one that was brought to
his notice as often as it could be effective. One evening,
some one told him he was too old to play football.
&#8220;Too old, mister?&#8221; he bawled; &#8220;Too old!&#8211;why,
give me that blasted ball,&#8221; and he stood there in a
prodigious rage, his eyes flashing, his fists knotting.
&#8220;Too old!&#8221;&#8211;His calenture ceased suddenly; there
was a tug on his fishing line. Up came a yellow catfish.
Never have I perceived a livelier disgust than
the look showed which he cast upon this victim. It
seemed to blame the catfish personally for not being a
rock salmon.</p>

<p>So Mouldytop regarded animated nature; which
regarded him as a man whose duties implied opportunities.
&#8220;I&#8217;m a poor man, mister.&#8221;&#8211;&#8220;The old son
of a gun says he&#8217;s a poor man. You old liar, you&#8217;ve
got streets of houses, you know you have.&#8221;</p>

<p>Some one who knew him at home was strongly of
opinion that he was less terrible by his own fireside:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>
that there was a fellow creature under whose guidance
he roared like any sucking dove. It might be.
Indeed, it was my impression that it could hardly be
otherwise. I thought I noticed a certain caution even
in his attitude to the large-bosomed laundrywoman
who took the ship&#8217;s orders at Buenos Aires; and his
comment on <i>her</i> charges had been of the weakest.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span><a id='link_26'></a>XXVI</h2>

<p>We crossed the line at six in the morning, and in
drizzling rain. There was not much comment, except
upon the rain; the good thing about the damp cloudy
weather was that we were spared the more furious
heat, though the atmosphere had been oily and sultry.
With the steamy clouds swarming about us I could
picture a past life hereabouts which might justly have
aroused man&#8217;s wrath; the sailing days, when to take
advantage of whatever brief breeze might visit the
sleepy doldrums, the sailors had to be constantly running
aloft in the drenching mist, and afterwards lay
down in their sweating glory-holes, in their soaked
clothes, week after week.</p>

<p>The painting epidemic was not abated. Meacock
and Mead camped out while they made their rooms as
white as ivory. Mead looked charming in a round
white cap, which he said a V.A.D. had given him.
The steward, with his experience of every sort of ship
under the sun, had developed an artistic eye: and,
perhaps to relieve the whiteness, he decided upon a
dado for the saloon, which hitherto had been from
ceiling to floor done in white enamel. The dado was
to be grained, in imitation of an actual wainscot. He
began his solemn task, applying by way of groundwork
a brimstone yellow and other sickly yellows
which disturbed us at meals.</p>

<p>Meacock and Phillips varied these days with a discussion
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>
of firemen, whether white or coloured firemen
were the more difficult to manage? Phillips was for
his Africans, the excellent selection aboard at present
forming a contrast with his memories of ne&#8217;er-do-wells,
&#8220;doctors, remittance-men and all sorts,&#8221; of
English birth. Meacock was soon hard at work
describing with amusing mimicry a refractory negro,
one of a number of Somalis who, hearing of labour
troubles in England, did their best to be paid off in
Africa. If they had succeeded, the ship would have
been without firemen for her return voyage; so their
efforts were resisted. The particular genius played
the hand of &#8220;suicidal tendency.&#8221; Choosing a time
when there were several people about the deck, he
climbed somewhat slowly up the bulwarks and prepared
with gestures to leap over the side. Meacock
was a spectator of this piece of acting. The actor was
pulled back with some violence, and &#8220;about half-past
four we got the handcuffs on him. We would have
had to turn the cook out of his room aft to lock this
fellow up, but I didn&#8217;t want to do that, so I fastened
him up with the handcuffs round a stanchion in the
poop. I said, &#8216;And the rats will probably eat you
before the morning&#8217;; and I really did expect to find
him eaten by the morning; for there were some
monsters in the poop.</p>

<p>&#8220;Next day, he began saying &#8216;Sick.&#8217;&#8211;&#8216;Sick?
Where are you sick?&#8217;&#8211;&#8216;Sick all over.&#8217; I had enough
of this after a bit, and went and got the strongest
black draught I&#8217;ve yet known. He didn&#8217;t want to
drink it, and I said to him, &#8216;Now drink this up as
quick as you can.&#8217; And so he did. After that, whenever
I looked in at the poop, this fellow would start
waving his arms and hollering out. In fact, he was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span>
mad; every time I got near him, he was mad. That
black draught was not popular, I think. When we got
to Cuxhaven, the medical authority put this man
through a careful examination. &#8216;He&#8217;s no more mad,&#8217;
he said, &#8216;than you or I. He&#8217;s got a slight touch of
rheumatics in the arm. But,&#8217; he said, &#8216;when you get
to Hamburg, you can satisfy yourself by sending this
man to the asylum.&#8217; We did. Two days&#8211;and he
was back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meacock&#8217;s laconic phrases were accompanied with
grimaces which told the tale to perfection.</p>

<p>The atmosphere had grown so literary that Mead
now took pencil and paper with him to his day watch
as a matter of course. The pages of the <i>Optimist</i> were
beginning to look somewhat laboured. He determined
to infuse a new vein. So a series of vividly
coloured hoaxes came into existence, the first of
which, a harem story, was too much in its full bloom
for the editor&#8217;s acceptance. Not surprised, and not
dejected, Mead offered &#8220;The Pirate,&#8221; and it duly
appeared. These fictions ended, as did their successors,
with a disillusionment:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>&#8220;And then what happened?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The film broke.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>It was about the period of hoaxes&#8211;April 1 arrived.
Bicker appeared at my cabin, where I was reading.
&#8220;Meacock wants to see you.&#8221; I went. Bicker
triumphed, and went his way convinced that he could
beat the intellectual at his own game, as the <i>Optimist</i>
had already shown him he could.</p>

<p>A brighter sky and cooler wind came on. We were
soon expected at Saint Vincent. The new moon and
calmer waters brought one evening of strange watery
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>
beauty. Towards his setting the sun had hidden himself
in black clouds, whence he threw a silver light over
sea spaces where sea and sky were meeting: he sank,
and left the heavens like green havens, with these
clouds slowly sailing through their utmost peace.
The change soon came; the head wind brought pale
grey turbulent days, with the ship playing at rocking-horses;
over the head wind and rousing sea, the
healthy sun at length dawned on the Sunday of our
arrival at Saint Vincent. Sunday, without the voice
of church bells or the sight of people going to worship,
seemed no Sunday despite its idle hours: at least, the
mood sometimes took me so.</p>

<p>The third engineer was acquiring no mean name as
a cutter of hair, and I felt the cold after I had been
to his open-air chair, near the engine-room staircase.
While I sat to him, a characteristic of the mess-room
boy was borne on the air from the chief&#8217;s room. It
was his habit of replying hastily to any observation,
&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; and this time the chief&#8217;s voice was heard:
&#8220;Curse you, John, for a blasted nuisance.&#8221; &#8220;Yes,
yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the sun was stooping under the sea once more,
land grew into sight far ahead; mountain or cloud?
The mountainous coast was mocked indeed by great
continents of cloud above, of its own grey hue. The
wind blew hard, but at ten o&#8217;clock we were running
in under the rocky pinnacles of Saint Vincent, against
the blustering wind and the black racing sea. A light
or two, chiefly from other steamers, told something
of the port. The crescent moon, cloaked in a circling
golden mist, was now near setting. We anchored
and spent the night in quiet.</p>

<p>A mile or so from our anchorage, in the morning&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>
clear air, huddled the pink unsightly little town. At
distance the heights of rock looked as unsubstantial
as Prospero&#8217;s magic; the clouds that swam over
them and across their steeps might have been solid,
so phantasmal were those rocks. Not so with the
stony masses overpeering the town; those in their
iron-brown nakedness had the aspect of eternal
immobility. The air was cold and lucent; the water
halcyon blue. Several tramps with rusty black and
red, and a sailing ship or two, lay around the <i>Bonadventure</i>;
barges of a rough old make clustered closer
in to shore.</p>

<p>The invasion by natives began early. A dozen
boats were tossing on the waves alongside, with woolly
heads and upward eyes seeking what or whom they
might devour, and quiet-footed rogues here and
there on the decks were trying to sell matches, cigarettes,
and red bead handbags. To their attempts,
the politest answer was &#8220;No good.&#8221; &#8220;No caree?&#8221;
Nobody seemed to care. Some of our firemen whose
homes were here had gone ashore, with the air of men
allowing their old haunts to share their glory.</p>

<p>Two lighters, coppered below, bearded with dark
green weed, blundered alongside with bags of coal,
and soon the gangs, a grimy and ragged collection,
were getting the bags aboard, and the winch
grumbling away. Yet it was now made known
that we were not to pick up much coal here, but to
proceed to Las Palmas for the bulk of our wants.
This was unfortunate for the firemen who had gone
home. All too soon the blue peter at half-mast and
the blowing of the hooter recalled them.</p>

<p>Now, too, it was rumoured that our port of discharge
was to be Emden, in Hanover: but of such
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>
arrangements it became more difficult to feel assurance.</p>

<p>At midday we left. The most valued effect of our
call at Saint Vincent was the receipt of some giant
flying-fishes, which we got, one apiece, at tea. It was
only by virtue of perseverance that a man could
consume his ration. They were good, if dry.</p>

<p>If I were a Bewick, I have in mind a little tailpiece
for this chapter. It would display, for the careful
eye, the hatless Kelly filleting a flying fish, against
the bunker hatch, for his friend the cat, who should
be gazing up with cupboard love at her unshaven
protector. The direction of the wind, in true Bewick
style, should be implied in a sprinkling of coal-dust
settling on the new paint of the &#8220;House.&#8221;</p>

<p>Glittering bright, northern weather outside.
&#8220;Channel weather,&#8221; as it was described at breakfast.
Whatever it might be, I was Jonah; fine, Jonah
bringing a head wind; wet, Jonah bringing the
wet; the ship rolling, it was Jonah&#8217;s additional
weight on the port side that was doing it; and so on.
The suggestion arose that the villain should be
offered to the first whale sighted; but &#8220;We should
have more respect for the whale,&#8221; said Phillips. Nor
could I be sure that I was not blamed for all finger
marks on the new paint. Meacock had been the
eye-witness of one crime of mine of the sort. &#8220;If
you touch that new enamel, your name&#8217;s mud&#8221;&#8211;and
then the <i>Bonadventure</i> obliged with a lurch sideways
which left the impression of my hand in a most
prominent place.</p>

<p>A more serious disgrace even befel me. Bicker
and Meacock involved me in an argument, which
was very quickly twisted into the direct question.
&#8220;Who was England&#8217;s greatest man?&#8221; Some
wretched ghost whispered Shakespeare, and Shakespeare
I named. There was derision. Shakespeare!
Nelson was the man. I was obliged to stick to my
choice. &#8220;We&#8217;re talking about fellows that <span class='sc'>DID</span>
something for their country,&#8221; said Meacock, and I
gave up. Bicker was once agaia <i>in excelsis</i> at this
evidence of his superior understanding, which he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>
seemed about to back up with physical argument.
The shade of Nelson was vindicated; and then, I
was informed that the second greatest man was
Kitchener. I asked with innocent ignorance what
he had effected of particular significance to our own
lives? A photograph was produced of the earlier, more
Achillean Kitchener, by way of settling <i>that</i> point.</p>

<p>Meeting Kelly in the galley one evening as I went
along to make my cocoa, I was detained to hear of
the wonders of Hamburg; and to watch Tich making
a Cornish cake with ingredients mysteriously come
by. Kelly was also of opinion that Hamburg&#8217;s high
place among towns was due to a dancing saloon,
where birthday suits were the fashion. &#8220;Flash
society,&#8221; he said with admiration. I was sorry to
hear that in the argument over great men I had
missed the sight of one whale. Thus it is with the
conversationally inclined: pursuing minnows of our
opinion, we miss the leviathans of fact.</p>

<p>Days of reviving fine weather and swaying sea in
hills and hollows, flinging proud manes of spray aloft
for the sun to gild with rainbows again and again,
gave place to one of skies generally overcast. Cold
blues and greens came and went above us; the wind
blew bleak over a steely sea. Land came into view
on the port beam. Above it the clouds hung in dim
phantasmagoria; a gleam of silver white below
announced the coast, and, now sparkling, now dull,
the lie of the land presented itself to our gaze. And
this was Grand Canary. The mountain&#8217;s sides
seemed chequered with forest; at its bases white
villages glistened; and further on, a conical peak and
headlands grew on the eye.</p>

<p>The sea had lately been crowded with porpoises,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>
acre upon acre; and here another vast assembly
crossed our track. To a credulous eye, as they leapt
along, they might have painted the image of several
sea serpents writhing through the waves. Above
them wheeled a flock of gulls, intent I supposed on
fishing.</p>

<p>The cathedral of Las Palmas appeared in mirage;
then the <i>Bonadventure</i> rounded the coast until the
town came clearly before us. It was to the harbour
just beyond the town that we were making. As we
approached, boats came rowing ferociously towards
us. One crew threw hooks carrying ropes over our
bulwarks, and sent a man aboard. His skill would
have done a spider credit; but to no purpose did he
exert it, for the hooks were thrown back and the
invader held prisoner on the bridge during Hosea&#8217;s
pleasure. When we anchored, a fleet of boats sprang
up around us, the chances of any individual one, of
course, for the privilege of supplying us with a bum-boatman
being smallish. Not long afterwards, the
ship was swarming with miscellaneous merchants,
and merchandise. Bananas, monkeys, canaries, cigarettes,
cigars, photographs (chiefly improper), wicker
chairs, matches, field glasses, parakeets and other
useful articles were pressed upon every one aboard
who could possibly be tackled. Some of the canaries
were heard whistling loud and long, and yet Kelly
found that the bird which he bought, a seeming
musician, was mute.</p>

<p>No cabin was left unguarded. It was pointed out
that one gentleman offered plain proof of knavery;
on his right foot he wore an English boot, on the left
a tennis shoe. They were all tarred with the same
brush: &#8220;Worse than Port Said.&#8221; I do not think
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>
they found much opportunity to enhance the reputation
at our expense.</p>

<p>A tug, the <i>Gando</i>, immediately re-named the <i>Can-do</i>,
brought out our lighters of coal. At that signal, an
interesting enterprise moved nearer to us. When
bags are being slung over from hold to hold, a good
deal of coal is dropped into the water; and so the
enterprise consisted in a small barge, with the men,
and material, for sending down divers to rescue the
estrays. The diver was a huge fellow, curiously
wearing a red tam-o&#8217;-shanter. He of course went
down in a diving suit to survey the ocean; when he
thrust his muzzle out of the water again, up would
come at the same time his two bushel baskets; and
as these were almost full of coal, presumably that
department of salvage had its rewards.</p>

<p>After much criticized anxiety about winches and
blocks and guys, our stevedore gangs began their
work at good speed. I was again dressed up in a
borrowed boiler suit for the duties of tallyman. The
weather became burning hot. The coal-dust flew
round in copious whirlpool. After an hour I was full
of discomfort, and not to be distinguished from any
of the coal heavers. Work continued in such hearty
fashion that I gathered that it was piece work. The
foreman was another giant, with such a belly on him
that whenever he gesticulated&#8211;that was often&#8211;stamping
his foot and brandishing his hands, that
belly really and truly quaked. His voice was not a
success. He would have roared like thunder, but
only a feeble croaking left his snapping jaws.</p>

<p>By six our bunker coals had been put aboard, I
discarded my honourable discomfort, my mask of
grime, and my piratical appearance. The dealers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>
in Constantinople canaries and cork soles withdrew.
About the harbour of La Luz, the lights came out in
the houses and aboard the shipping; the masts and
yards stood out calm against a quiet coloured evening,
the water rippled with no skirmish nor much voice
to our sides. Beyond the towns, the mountains
gloomed with the dreams of romantic journeys.</p>

<p>An hour or so afterwards, the welcome though
broken melody of the anchor&#8217;s uprising heralded our
departure. It had been a colourable interlude. I
remember it best by a circular handed out by
&#8220;Gumersindo Alejandro, Bumboat Business.&#8221; It
ran through the rigmarole of desirable articles, a few
of which I have named above, and concluded</p>

<p>By some mystical means, the mates had charmed
away from our Las Palmas visitors at small cost or
none an unusual supply of cigars and cigarettes.
These brightened up the melancholy purser, who was
now approaching the end of his employment. There
were still, however, many things to amuse his leisure.
How often the table talk had come to the subject of
hell and its occupants! The latter seemed to be&#8211;after
the landlubbers&#8211;shipowners, ship&#8217;s chandlers, ship&#8217;s
tailors, and Customs men. Curious pictures were
projected of notorious shipowners of the past, now
compelled to wield the shovel next to the firemen late
of their employ. As to the unfortunate Customs
officials, witness A and B.</p>

<p>A. &#8220;... Yes, he quite got pally with this Customs
fellow&#8213;?&#8221;</p>

<p>B (<i>older than A, hastily interrupting</i>): &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t

Mead added &#8220;The Vamp&#8221; to his cabinet of tales of

<p>The northern spring came into the air. Scraps of
the casual verse of one English poet who never tired
of the year afield started up in memory now, where
the pondered solemn music of others had no reverberation;
and so for the rest of my voyage. The sea
for a time grew intensely calm, the swell seeming to
swim along under a mantle of pearl or quicksilver.
The undulating surface stretched to the horizon,
unbroken anywhere by restless foam; and over this
calm lay the golden track to the setting sun. When
presently a breeze ruffled this strange sleep, it was
as though shoals of tiny fishes had everywhere risen
to the surface; and in one or two places, those
bubbling, flickering shoals were actual and not
imaginary.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>As if schooled by misfortune, Sparks now posted
up in the port alleyway a statement of football results
and tables; so that many bosoms aboard needed no
longer to feel a heaving anxiety. A turtle lazily
floated by, watched by many who could have
welcomed him on deck; a whale passed, shouldering
and spouting the brine; and shortly, as the midnight
moon had portended, the dark green sea began to run
in hilly ridges, sometimes sluicing the decks, and
tilting the <i>Bonadventure</i> to one side or the other.
Grey rain-squalls flew over us now and then; but,
considering our near approach to the redoubtable
Bay, we were in excellent weather. The mate, however,
was not one to take chances; and certain
barrels, an anvil and a few other heavy movables
were shifted from the windward side of the engines.</p>

<p>The steward and his adjutant had now little time
certain in which to reform my room, so they fell upon
it with paint brushes and &#8220;flat white&#8221; in vigorous
style; it had been my hope to be allowed this labour,
but I remembered my &#8220;Tom Sawyer,&#8221; where painting
as a recreation was so truly valued. Mouldytop
was seldom seen in these days without his pot and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>
brush; he went at it from dawn to midnight and
then did overtime. My room was turned into a
whited sepulchre, which is better than a sooted
one, but as it was a sort of receptacle for coal-dust,
which was coal grease withal, even when port,
ventilator and door were all closed, it was to be
feared, <i>tamen usque recurret</i>, it would be black again
in a week.</p>

<p>We came into a region of ships, tramps like ourselves
for the most part, and the less handsome
oil-tankers also. Finisterre lighthouse shone kindly
upon us. With a fair wind, the concourse of shipping
dwindling away somewhat as we went on, we now
entered the Bay. Our angles began to be anything
but right, but it was much gentler weather than I
had any reason to need. Fair as it was for us, save
for the cinders that fell in showers amidships, the
vessels running in the teeth of the weather were pitching
with vigour. Grey and shrouded the sea met us
in hills and valleys, with white ridges and flecked
with foaming veins; as we went further into the
famous corner, the <i>Bonadventure</i> could not but roll
and lurch as though she liked it, and the waves were
mountainous; yet out there we passed a fishing boat
making beautiful weather of it.</p>

<p>The second mate, Bicker, could scarcely get any
sleep; but not on any score of weather or discomfort.
All his watch below, or most of it, one might see him
standing at his sea chest with pen scratching away at
the forthcoming <i>Optimist</i>. So sweet is journalism
when wooed as a casual mistress. Shall I go on?
No.</p>

<p>My trouble was not what to write but what to read.
Even Young&#8217;s <i>Night Thoughts</i>, buried in annotations
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>
reverent and irreverent, began to grow familiar
beyond all reason. <i>Pears&#8217; Cyclopædia</i>, <i>Brown&#8217;s
Nautical Almanac</i>, <i>The South Indian Ocean Pilot</i>,
<i>Phrenology for All</i>, and other borrowed books, were
all at much the same stage. This ship was not the
one recently reported in the newspapers in which the
chief read poetry like a passion, the cook chewed
Froude with his morning crust, and the cabin-boy
needed the help of Hegel. I forget if those were the
actual claims, but in any case that was another ship.
About now, an accident happened to my Young.
It seemed as if a Poltergeist had visited the spare
cabin port during the night, for awaking I found my
settee, and the <i>Night Thoughts</i> thereon, waterlogged.
Perhaps the heavy rain had been answerable for this,
but I could not see how&#8211;my port was closed. Poltergeist
had spared my novel, lying next to Young:
evidently he thought that already watery enough.
Young, immortal, made a surprising recovery.</p>

<p>Now, we were nearing the one country. It needed
no drab island of Ushant with its lighthouse to tell
me this; for hardly had I put down in my diary
&#8220;Much milder,&#8221; when it became necessary to write
&#8220;Much colder.&#8221; The tumults of the Bay were over
and gone, and we were under a dun sky dropping
rain which obviously belonged to the English Channel.</p>

<p>We swung round Ushant and became more aware
of the ups and downs of navigation; these were less
noticeable as we ran on. The prospect, or say circumspect
of the day was narrowed in by dismal rainstorm,
and once more it was a bleak amusement trying
to make out the forms of ships through the foggy
veils. The wind moaning, the rain splashing,
measured out long hours, till all saddened into night
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>
with little to notice, save the gulls and divers whom
such weather suited well. At any rate we were not
unfortunate in our direction. The <i>Hammonia</i> going
the other way with passengers showed us that by
contrast.</p>

<p>The night elapsed, we came abeam of the Isle of
Wight, which showed but indistinctly, though the
day was cold and steady. Calm indeed lay the green
Channel up which the <i>Bonadventure</i> with speed
sufficient to please Phillips was making her way.
Ships, or their smoky evidences, made the time pass
quickly. It was Good Friday, a great day for my
childhood in Kent, land of plum-pudding-dogs and
monkey-tail trees, a day when I heard, as indeed my
elder companions had long foretold, the church bells
rung muffled; although I was disappointed in the
purple cassocks which, tradition fabled, would be
worn by the choir on that day. Lent (and Advent
too for that matter) was solemn then and real, outside
of churches; and with Good Friday it appeared
undeniable that there had been done some thing at
which Nature must go in mourning. The three
hours&#8217; service, like the watch that rang out the dying
year and rang in the new, was in every one&#8217;s thought
that we met; such ceremony was not for nothing.
The melancholy hymns of the season were more than
sung verses.</p>

<p>To-day, at least, we had hot-cross buns to our
breakfast. So is the Lord remembered in these years
of discretion. The sailors had the day to themselves.</p>

<p>Our course lay more or less east, and brought us a
succession of glimpses of shining cliffs and misty
downs. Off Dover we saw both coasts at once. In
1919 I hoped I had seen the last of that piece of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>
France. Running out of this strait into the North
Sea under a shrewish though a moderate wind, we
passed a number of fishermen, and what struck my
mind with the strangeness almost of the Flying
Dutchman, a three-masted barque under full sail, at
a distance. It was sunset at the time. She caught
the light and bowed upon her journey, a sweet sight,
too quickly lost in the dark. Soon we picked up the
flash of a lightship off the Dutch shore, and soon after
that the cold to which my wanderings had not made
me careless sent me inside.</p>

<p>Chilly brightness and blue sky saw us making
rapidly over the North Sea, visited by thrushes and
linnets, while the water seemed crowded with those
clever birds, though so gawky upon the wing, the
divers. We crossed the wake of an oil-tank, burning
the water almost like the witch&#8217;s oils in &#8220;The Ancient
Mariner,&#8221; and scenting the air unlike those abstractions;
came to a lightship, where our course was
altered; and met the pilot cutter in a calm sea and
air vivid with sun and cold about four. The rope
ladder went down, the row-boat came alongside, and
the pilot was taken up to the bridge. I could not
repress odd emotions at thus seeing again &#8220;Brother
Boche&#8221;&#8211;he looked a replica of ancient types of my
acquaintance&#8211;after such a long separation.</p>

<p>The estuary of the Ems received us, a flat sheet of
water, with low coastlands only noticed by reason of
towers here and there. The tides obliged us to anchor
some miles outside Emden at six, and to wait until
midnight. The sky darkened and loured into rain.
At twelve in a black and gusty night, to the accompaniment
of much hooting and shouting, the <i>Bonadventure</i>
moved up the river, and in the greyness and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>
chill of daybreak berthed in a quiet basin at Emden.</p>

<p>Through this last movement I had tried to snatch
some sleep, but was harassed by the socialism of
Bicker and Mead, who considered it but fair that as
they were being deprived of their sleep, I should be
deprived of mine. They, therefore, visited me at
intervals, switched on my fan which was now quite
unnecessary, prodded me with toasting-forks, and so
saluted the happy morn, like those larks which were
now singing and soaring to justify any praise of them
that ever was written.</p>

<p>On Easter Day the sun&#8211;it was an old proverb&#8211;will
dance; and this time he was in the mood. We lay
in a basin like other tramps; beyond, there clustered
red roofs with blessed ungainly angles, a pleasing
sight after those southern flat ones of grey. Farther
off, the church spire climbed above the trees, and
though many people in their Sunday dress were
walking that way, more were taking their rounds
beside these docks.</p>

<p>It was as certainly good to be here as that spring
was here. The chirrup of sparrows, jubilate of larks,
noises of poultry, bleating of lambs from an enclosure
of young fruit trees close at hand, and the play of
children, were all comely and reviving.</p>

<p>Alas! that the Easter gift of the ship&#8217;s officers
should have been so out of tune. An old gentleman
of the same outlook as Polonius, the broker, brought
a packet of letters aboard at breakfast, and among
these were the wrong kind of Easter tidings&#8211;statements
of their reductions in wages. They accepted
this falling off without murmur, save for a few dry
remarks.</p>

<p>A motor-boat came bringing the stores, and, to the
disgust of the cook and other watchers, a great stack
of long loaves, altogether leathery in external appearance.
Most of these were returned. The ship&#8217;s
chandler must have thought we were arriving in force.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>
Our own boat was tied at the foot of the gangway, and

<p>Next day the larks were aloft again, and their
melody, marvellous after long absence from it, came
dropping from heaven as undiminished, one would
say, as raindrops falling. So clear it sounded there
even when they were in the clouds. Meanwhile the
bosun and party were getting the winches and derricks
into trim, with less silver voices: &#8220;H-h-hup, H-h-hup:
Let go a little: Here, youse....&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not unwelcome when the evening came, and
Mead, Bicker, and their friend so soon to be returned
to duty set out up the cobbled road to Emden; most
bitter was the east wind blowing down the long
colonnades of trees, and we hastened into the sheltering
streets of the little town. We found it a quiet and
beautiful place of ornamentation, and gables and
high houses, with a canal in the midst. Masterly
seemed its spire, stretching up into the sky with
unexpected height and charming ease. It was Easter
Monday, and many folks were walking out&#8211;we
looked curiously about us, and while none were
anything but tidy and decent, none had any of the
symptoms of much and to spare. They were
evidently poor, but far from poor in spirit.</p>

<p>We were puzzled by the Sabbath look of things to
find a place to sit down and apply some antidote to
the effects of that rawish east wind. We began
drifting as usual, when an old fellow in black coat
and Homburg hat pushed past us, mumbling something.
A light came swiftly into the eyes of Mead
and Bicker; the old fellow was fragrant with good
beer. We asked him for directions. He was off at
once in a loud, hard voice: &#8220;By Jesus Christ and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>
General Jackson,&#8221; he began (and <i>da capo</i>), &#8220;the two
best men in America. You come to my house.&#8221;
Following him, and coping with his repeated invocations
of the Messiah and the General, and requests
for an opinion of his English speech, we arrived by and
by. He was an innkeeper, and (by Jesus Christ)
&#8220;an old sailing man himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>The inn parlour was most excellently warm, free
and easy. We set to with hot grog, the brimmer
being rebrimmed (if my memory serves me) not once
nor twice. The room was not one which depressed.
Around it hung daubs of full-rigged ships of Batavia
in the fifties and sixties; there was an automatic
weighing machine, a most magnificent penny-in-the-slot
piano, and another apparatus for extracting
copper from the air, dressed up as a blue windmill,
but I did not inquire what it was expected to yield.
And the wall-paper was tapped with an ample border,
in which one saw smooth waters, placid smacks, and
more windmills.</p>

<p>The other occupants of the room were the quiet
set at the tables, a drunken Finn seaman with one
arm in bandages, a dark-haired musician, the landlord
and his wife and their good-looking daughter; while
from the private house other members of the family
came and went at need, as will be seen.</p>

<p>We provided the landlord with grog. He melted
with gratitude, rose, and set his horrible piano going,
whose wicked hammers champed upon some of the
harshest wires outside of the barbed-wire dumps.
And what is more, whenever the piano began, our
friend the Finn thought his hour had come to shine,
and essayed a sort of stamping, stooping dance across
the floor. This led to persuasion. The landlord
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>
persuaded, the landlady persuaded, unclassified assistants
persuaded, and presently the dancer was pleased
to be seated once more, exclaiming, &#8220;When I come
aboard he says to me, he says, &#8216;All right, Captain, all
right, all right.&#8217;&#8221; No sooner did the music begin
afresh than this enthusiast would rise up relentlessly
as though hypnotized (by the pæan) and perhaps
stamp out a bar or two before being replaced by combined
efforts. This kept on happening.</p>

<p>None the less, the landlord, who had apparently
spent the day in liquid rejoicings, was swallowing
grog and growing taleful. He claimed all sorts of
sea service and seemed to know what he was talking
about, posed even my expert friends with the sailing-ship
question: What&#8217;s the difference in build between
a Scotch ship, a Nova Scotian, and a Yankee? Boxing
too was in his line: &#8220;Scholar of John L. Sullivan,&#8221;
he assured us, and directed admiration to his fist,
which was normal. From taleful he waxed tuneful.
&#8220;I&#8217;m a chanty-man, y&#8217;know,&#8221; and wiping back his
gingery-white whiskers he groaned out &#8220;Blow the
man down,&#8221; and &#8220;The streams of our native Australia,&#8221;
in dreadful style. After these, finding himself
strangely appreciated, he offered and began &#8220;a real
English song, y&#8217;know&#8211;exchoose me, y&#8217;know, if I
don&#8217;t speak the plain English.&#8221; It was &#8220;The Maid
of the Mill.&#8221; His rendering was a strain on our tact,
and too much for one of the young ladies of the house,
who was smitten with a fit of giggling most right and
justifiable. At that, the old villain flew into a
ridiculous passion, jumped up, and was for hitting
this girl. He was restrained.</p>

<p>After this unwanted diversion, he returned and
(with starts of rage) barked out the rest of his song.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>
His wolfhound began, and we began, to find the
vocalist a nuisance; and as the evening wore on, I
thought the authentic musician, who played the
violin, was beginning to resent our presence and
success. The daughter of the house foolishly sat at
our table. The musician, however, was soothed
with an honorarium, and with much &#8220;Auf wieder-sehen!&#8221;
we went. Even now, however, it was thought
unseemly to reach the ship in one journey, so halts
were called twice; and once aboard, the usual arguments
kept us out of our beds until four or so in the
morning.</p>

<p>The two grain-elevators in the port were still busy
with a Greek steamer, so that, apart from painting,
the <i>Bonadventure</i> was idle, and there was little to do
but row over to the canteens and return with
undreamed-of quantities of chocolate and cigarettes.
Cigars were, to us, as lightly bought as matches.
As to the painting, it was again mysterious that two
of the apprentices fell off the stage on which they
were working alongside; they were soon dressed in
borrowed plumage. Suddenly in the evening our
discharge began.</p>

<p>Lighters of the local type, very long and narrow,
were already alongside when the tugs swung the first
elevator into his place. The huge floating turret
looked somewhat like a smock mill. The stevedores
quickly made fast their tackle: four large drain-pipe
tubes were let down into the chosen hold, and the
suckers commenced. There was a drumming boom
of machinery, mixed with the swish of the ingulfing
of the grain and its disgorging through broader conduits
on the other side of the elevator into the river
barges. It grew dark, the red and green railway
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>
lights burned fiercely in brisk air against the last of
an orange sunset. But the elevator was kept at work,
and arc lights hung over the hold showed the novel
scene of the sliding grain and its trimmers.</p>

<p>One effect of the late-continued drone and thud of
the elevator was to torment me with war dreams.
First I was in an attack, among great rocks, under a
violent barrage; then, on one of those unforgettable
raw, dark mornings, I was at the window of a great
ruined house behind the line, watching the bleary
effulgence of the Very lights starting up here and
there and expecting the worst from a nasty silence,
only pierced by single shell-bursts. Then, beside
the elevator, an infuriated and intoxicated bargee
stood on the landing-stage about midnight bawling
for a boat which didn&#8217;t come. His patience was,
however, considerable; he bawled for a long hour.
In consequence, I suppose, of these matters I arrived
very late at breakfast amid the usual cries of &#8220;You
Jonah, you!&#8221;</p>

<p>The second elevator arrived, and, like some great
iron insect with many beaks, began to swallow up
the grain from the holds aft. The ship shook with
the speed and power of the pumping machinery; the
long lighters with their great round-table steering
wheels filled up, battened down, and swung away.
In one of the holds there were the bags put in at
Ingeniero White; under them again lay the yellow
grain in mass. The elevator&#8217;s proboscis dipped into
that grain, while the trimmers unstowed, slit and
emptied the sacks; so the ship began to lighten, and
her bow already stood high out of the water.</p>

<p>The red evening sky was smoky with cold; then
the stars sparkled with frost; and a small gathering
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>
enjoyed the oil stove in Bicker&#8217;s room. The steward,
in unusual radiance, came in presently, and sang a
long song concerning a tramp who was flung off a
freight train by a brakesman. &#8220;Because he was
only a tramp&#8221; (<i>dying fall</i>).</p>

<p>This might have been a comment on Mr. W. H.
Davies&#8217; Autobiography. Warmed with his singing
and other helps, the steward began to recall his
acquaintance (on guard) with Royalty, and spun off
at tangents with affairs half a century more recent:
&#8220;That b&#8213; flaming butcher&#8211; I was going to hit
him with a box of matches,&#8221; and other incidents. I
was sorry to hear the lank Chips, the next morning,
bawling at the entrance of the saloon a complaint
about the toughness of his meat; the steward&#8217;s new
mood deserved anything but that sort of damper.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span><a id='link_30'></a>XXX</h2>

<p>With little to do, I fought a sort of pillow fight
with Meacock, our weapons being sacks well stuffed;
he won, of course, but it was a popular bout. Then
there were acrobatic performances on the stays
of the funnel. The need I had for training appeared
on our last night in Emden Port, when my sleep
was nipped in the bud by the entry of Bicker and
Mead. Both had the clear spirits raised, in two
senses; both thickened voices already thick enough.
They were disguised (Mead&#8217;s fancy, I warrant) as
members of the Ku-Klux-Klan; and besides their
costume one bore a revolver, the other an air gun
impounded from an apprentice. I was ordered out
of bed, but wished to stop; we argued about it and
by good luck I hung on. After this, insidious, they
declared that a lady who knew me and wished to
see me had come aboard. This flight of fancy and
flow of language went on until they sought variety,
which they found in painting the unfortunate Tich
in the alley below in several colours.</p>

<p>The German police, green men and true, watched the
ship closely. It was rumoured that a shipping clerk
and a young woman had eloped and were aboard one
of the tramps. &#8220;Love in a foc&#8217;sle,&#8221; especially
ours, was considered no bad joke.</p>

<p>One more home circle was held in the starboard
alleyway towards midnight; gin very prevalent,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>
and the steward also. He fell into a sequence of
army recollections, which (as the glass was thrust
replenished into his hand) began on this pattern,
&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m telling you, Mister, at three in the afternoon
of March the twelfth 1873, we was parading
outside the Queen&#8217;s pavilion....&#8221; Once more also
Mead and myself made our way into Emden. The
old nooks of buildings and the vistas of narrow
thoroughfares and lazy waterways, the shops and
the folk, all made a kindly picture; after supper,
we avoided a downpour of sleet in a café with an
orchestra, whose repertory of 4,000 pieces included
two by English composers, and his name was Sullivan.
On our midnight way home, we stopped at a Dutchman&#8217;s
bar and asked for and got a dozen hard-boiled
eggs for a second supper aboard. I was carrying a
parcel in hand and two bottles, or rather gas-cylinders,
of gin in the lining of my mackintosh when we reached
the German sentry-box beside the Quay. He puffed
at his pipe as he felt the parcel and saw that all
was well.</p>

<p>The iron in the ship began to sweat great drops, and
the walls of one&#8217;s bunk glistened with damp. The
glass was falling; the water of the basin no longer
lay smooth as oil but beat against the ship grudgingly.
In short, excellent Flanders weather ensued the old-established
weather, guaranteed to cure rabid individuals
of war cant after one hour&#8217;s trial (unshelled)
on sentry-go or at the ration dump. For the worst
and even hopeless cases, half an hour&#8217;s trial on the
banks of the Steenbeck was confidently recommended&#8211;I
was lucky now to have a roof leaking but little.
Phillips showed me the one dry corner in his room&#8211;a
portion of the settee about a foot square.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>Hosea&#8217;s wife joined us in the saloon, and not
only by her genial presence itself merited our best
thanks, but also by her influence on the steward. As
if by magic, Ideal milk was added to our tinned pears
(usually, apricots); and the jam changed to strawberry.</p>

<p>At length the elevators ceased from troubling, and
the supervisors from dilating in <i>Platt Deutsch</i> over the
damage in the bilges. The bosun&#8217;s strangled noise
timed the hoisting of the ship&#8217;s boat, which had had a
busy holiday, to its normal place. The little broker
made his last appearance round the steward&#8217;s
precincts; and with the heaving up of the gangway,
the arrival of the tugs, the return of the wireless
aerial to its heights and the smoking funnel&#8211;it,
no doubt, never looked better&#8211;we were ready to
depart.</p>

<p>It was twilight when our ropes fore and aft were
loosed from the dolphins, and the <i>Bonadventure</i>
slowly moved into the lock. Here while the port
authorities made a swift inspection for stowaways
and concluded their arrangements, we stopped a time,
listening to the odd mixture of noise from bleating
of sheep and hooting of our whistle. Then we moved
out to sea, not without bumping into the lock wall
and gashing the bow. The air was intensely cold,
and the iron frameworks against the last tinges of
sunset and the red and white lights were now all
there was to see of our port of discharge. That
episode was over; after midnight, the ship stopped
at Borkum to put down the pilot, and then, on
again. My voyage was hurrying into memory.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span><a id='link_31'></a>XXXI</h2>

<p>Short seas running and a squally wind abeam made
the light ship jerk and roll. The early sun was
hidden in the dull purple of a racing sleet-cloud,
which passed over the <i>Bonadventure</i> and swept on
to lash the dunes of Holland lying dim blue along the
yellow horizon. The engines beat out a cheerful
tattoo and sent the ship, wobbling as she went, at
eleven knots through the green water. The wind
grew westerly but not sisterly; the melancholy
began to expatiate on the short text, &#8220;The Longships,&#8221;
but the profusion of fishing smacks out around us
seemed to show that no tempestuous weather was at
hand.</p>

<p>The next morning, a spiritual Beachy Head was
glittering like crystal in the distance; while the
head wind fell upon us, and momently a great thud
like the impact of a great shell shook the ship&#8217;s
sizable frame and lifted her in see-saw style. I
watched the south coast sliding by with as much
excitement as if I had been coming home on leave
again. Meacock was at his most picturesque with his
reminiscences of a hard-case ship called the <i>Guildhall</i>,
but I could not retain what he told me, with
this distraction of English shores and skies about
us. The general scene recorded itself; of all the
magnificent evenings which my voyage had brought
forth this was perhaps the nonpareil. The skies
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>
were of tumultuous colour, requiring one of the old
Dutch masters to observe, let alone to reproduce. A
bright brazen sun, throwing at his whim (as it were)
his vesture of clouds about him, burnt out below a
pavement of light ever seething with the leaping
waves, and sometimes hidden, sometimes emerging,
lit the sky astern to a tawny glow, or left it sullen
as clay. Here, the horizon was an olive green,
there, a blue girdle; ships in stippled blackness
tilted this way and that against it, or nearer ploughed
grey expanses; and above pillars and cliffs of rocky
cloud lifted themselves enormously into a firmament
purpled or kindled into wild flame.</p>

<p>So we hurtled along, the wind flawing, abeam, ahead.
The great prow mounted high against the sunset, or
thrust like the head of a porpoise down again into the
onslaught of rolling waters. The hand on the lookout
paced up and down the foc&#8217;sle head in loneliness,
the officer on the bridge answered his call as ever,
the seagulls followed the ship with their unvarying
calm and pride of wing. Presently the fine light
of Eddystone was our solace.</p>

<p>The last day of my pursership dawned, a day I
welcomed and yet was sorry to find come. How
swiftly it stole by! At seven that morning we were
midway between the Longships lighthouse and that yet
lonelier one the Wolf, with Land&#8217;s End white with
snow to feast the eye. The sun was a Jolly Bacchus,
the waves dancing as green as the young leaves
sacred to that god, and the happy porpoises ambled
among them. Yet still, as we swung round the corner,
in a veritable procession of funnels and smoke trails,
a squall came down, heralded by a half-seen rainbow,
threw us rudely off the poise and chilled the air to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>
winter again. But round went the <i>Bonadventure</i>
and coasted beneath moors and tors sullenly green
into the Bristol Channel.</p>

<p>The heavy rolling died away as we passed from the
Cornish shore (where they are said to eat strangers),
and my Emden chilblains felt the weather growing
much warmer. Indeed, we had not had so mild a day
since we left Las Palmas. Towards three we came
abreast of Lundy Island&#8217;s bluff, and Hartland
opposite, a sturdy cliff likewise. The tide helped us
well, but the wind was veering. Urged by those
officers and engineers whose wives would be at Barry
Docks this evening to greet them, and by his own
wishes, the chief had promised to bring the <i>Bonadventure</i>
to the tier in Barry Docks by seven.</p>

<p>Ilfracombe nestling happily under the moors was
quickly passed; the <i>Bonadventure</i> could move when
she had a mind; the mellow green country of Somerset
parcelled in such English fashion with such straight
hedgerows, faded astern. The coast of Wales revealed
the twin lighthouses called the Nash Lights, and still
the ship raced on. Then, as if before the time, we
were entering the locks at Barry, in a smoky twilight,
after an evening shower; were inside, and tied up to
the tier.</p>

<p>Not much remains to add. The next day I scrambled
down the rope ladder, and bade farewell to the
<i>Bonadventure</i>, that &#8220;dirty ship,&#8221; not unbeloved;
and Mead came next. The boat below carried us to
the quay, under the red hulls of ships gleaming
with the light from the dancing ripples; then came
paying off, a most unpunctual and irritating performance,
and good-byes to the old friends, from
Hosea to Kelly, of the last few months; and most
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>
of all, perhaps, to that gay spirit Mead. My good-bye
to these might be, I hoped, no such final one;
but my round trip was accomplished and I felt that
for me &#8220;there would be no more sea,&#8221; so that the
actual signing off of the purser seemed to me a
point in my life&#8217;s course. Then presently, after a
hearty last word with Mead&#8211;kind be the dog-watch
stars to him, wherever his ship carry him&#8211;I departed;
the last train for Slowe having, naturally, gone out,
I made for the nearest town to Slowe, and finishing
my journey part on foot, part on a borrowed bicycle,
was enabled to awaken Mary while the rest of the
parish of Staizley slept the sleep of the just.</p>
